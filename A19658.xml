            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I doo not require any of you to giue credit to that which I haue written: before you haue tried the ſame, and found it worthy of credit. And therefore I haue ſet ouer the heads of the pages of this my booke: this admonition: <hi>Firſt trie, and then truſt:</hi> If you shall finde that I haue ſufficiently prooued all thoſe thinges
<pb facs="tcp:11401:5"/> that your Offerer requireth the protestant to prooue: then I hope you wil redily performe, thoſe Offers that he hath made. And if you shall finde any inſufficiency in mine anſweres: I hope, that ſome of the learned on your ſide, will vſe ſome meanes whereby I may haue knowledge of that inſufficiency. And in the word &amp; faith of a Christian, I doo promiſe you, that what ſoeuer any of you shal write touching this matter: I will reade it deliberatly, and without all parciall affection, with earneſt prayer to the almighty, for the direction of his holy ſpirite, whereby I may be ſtayed from ſtraying out of the way of truth. I know that there is but one way to euerlaſting life, &amp; I doo know that Christ only is that way: if any of your ſort therefore, can make it plaine vnto me, that your popish Catholique church dooth walke in that way, then will I leaue that way wherein wee proteſtants doo walk, and runne with you for I tell you truly, that none of you can haue a greater or more earneſt deſire, to enter with the Bridgrome Chriſt, then I haue, and (as I hope) shall haue to the end. My pen would gladly proceede, in paynting my paper with moe ſentences to the like effect: but I haue thought good to ſtay it, for that I doo perſuade my ſelfe, that you doo think the time longe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you can take in hand to performe that requeſt that I haue herein made. Frare you well. From my houſe at S. <hi>Gyles</hi> without Creplegate of London. The Lord Ieſus direct you in all that you shall doo. Amen.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the yeere of our</hi> Lord. <hi>1586.</hi> there came to my handes (by what meane I doo not well knowe, but by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence of God, I am ſure) a certaine booke, that had béen im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed and publiſhed in <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> (in the yéere <hi>1575.</hi>) in the Engliſhe Tongue.

               <p>This booke lay by me (as a thing whereof I made ſmall accompt) tyll the moneth of <hi>May</hi> in the yéere <hi>.1587.</hi> When hauing (by occaſion) more ſpare time, then in long time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I had, or could haue: I tooke this booke in hand, and did deliberately reade ouer, both y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> booke and the offers.

<pb facs="tcp:11401:6"/> trueth and ſinceritie: that I coulde not but thinke that the hauing of this booke in ſecrete, hath béene one great cauſe of the Apoſtacie, of ſo many young men, as haue in late yéeres fallen away from the pure profeſſion of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and haue imbraced and profeſſed, and doo ſtill profeſſe moſt vnpure Popiſh religion.</p>
               <p>The booke was firſt written, by the aboue named <hi>Iohn de Albine</hi> (as it may be thought) either in the Latine, or in the French tonge: Wherefore I meane not to beſtow any time in the anſwering of it, ſuppoſing that either <hi>Beza,</hi> or ſome other French Proteſtant hath already dealt therein ſufficiently.</p>
               <p>But becauſe the offers ſéeme to be made by ſome Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh man, and haue not (as I thinke) béene aunſwered by any man: I haue thought good to ſupply the place of that learned Proteſtant, that the Popiſh Catholique, ment to make the offers vnto.</p>
               <p>And that the Offerer (if hee be yet liuing) or any fréende of his (if he be departed this lyfe) may not haue any cauſe to miſlike with my dealing herein: I minde to ſetfoorth to the view of the Reader, all the words of the Offerer, euen as I finde them, and as I haue them to ſhew, in his printed Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie, which I haue, and doo mind to kéepe, in a readineſſe to ſhewe, not abiding or dimniſhing, altering or changing, one ſentence, worde, ſillable, letter or title.

               <p>The Offerer.</p>
               <p>Firſt, ſeeing it cannot bee denied, that our ſauiour Chriſt before his departure, and aſcenſion, did commit the charge and gouernment of his Church, the teſtimony of his worde, the truth of his goſpell, the miniſtration of his Sacraments to his Apoſtles and Diſciples, and that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for them ſelues, but to their ſucceſſors Biſhops and Prieſts, and to none other, ſaying only to them: <hi>Euntes do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cete omnes gentes.</hi>

               <p>If theſe Rulers that ſaint <hi>Paule</hi> willeth the Hebrews to ſalute, were ſuch as you ſay they were, when hée com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth them to obey (that is to ſay Biſhops, &amp; Prieſts) then was not this Epiſtle written to them, but to the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour ſorte amongſt the Hebrews, which is a thing too ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd to bée graunted. For what ciuilitie, honeſtie, or wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, may that man bée thought to haue, that would write ſuch an Epiſtle as this, to the inferiours of any congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſtians, and not to the ſuperiours of the ſame congregation? Theſe Hebrews were Chriſtians, and dwelt (as my bée thought) in ſundrie Cities, within the

And it is like, that the Apoſtle (being in Italy when hée wrote this Epiſtle) had ſome occaſion to admoniſh them, of that opinion which commonly the poſteritie of <hi>Abraham</hi> held: which was, that they ought not to liue in ſubiection to any rulers that were not of the ſame poſteritie: And therefore hée wrote vnto them as before, <hi>Obedite, &amp;c.</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey your Superiours, and ſubmit your ſelues vnto them. And as in this place, <hi>Salutate, &amp;c.</hi> Salute all thoſe that be in authority ouer you. As though hée ſhould haue ſaid thus. I know that you would gladly bée gouerned (as you are Hebrews borne) by ſuch as bée Hebrews, as you are, and (as you are Chriſtians) by Chriſtians as your ſelues bée: But ſith you ſée, that God will haue it otherwiſe: let ſuch as God hath ſet ouer you, haue their due honour at your hands: Obey them, honour them, ſerue them, giue them all tributes and cuſtoms due vnto them, and pray to God for them, that you may leade a peaceable and quiet life vnder them.

               <p>This may bée the meaning of the Apoſtle, in thoſe woords that you haue cited, and in the other that follow.

It appéereth manifeſtly by the Apoſtles words, that they were the ſame that had prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the goſpell vnto them, and had continued conſtant, in preaching the ſame doctrine to the end of their liues: and had ſealed it with their blood. For the Apoſtle ſaith thus. Conſidering what the end of their conuerſation hath bin: which can not bée ment of any, that did then preſently go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne or teach them. Yea, and how could the Apoſtle take vpon him to commaund Emperours, Kings, Quéenes, and Princes: to obey ſuch Biſhops, and Prieſtes, as the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews (being a ſimple ſort of Chriſtians) could haue to rule and teach them?</p>
               <p>The teſtimonies therefore, that you alleage (M. Offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer) may right well bée denyed, for they teſtifie not that which you would affirme by them. For although the charge and gouernment of the Church of Chriſt, the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the doctrine of the goſpell, and the miniſtration of the ſacraments of Chriſt, were committed, to the Apoſtles and Diſciples of Chriſt, and to their ſucceſſours: yet are not the ſame committed to your Biſhops and Prieſts, for they are not the ſucceſſours eyther of Chriſt or any Apoſtle, or Dyſciple of Chriſt, except you will néedes haue them the ſucceſſors of <hi>Iudas Iſcariot,</hi> or of <hi>Simon Magus.</hi>

               <p>I hope that M. Offerer dooth now ſée, that the ſeconde point of doctrine that hée requireth the learned Proteſtant to ſhew, by plaine teſtimonies of Scripture, to bee ſuch as the Apoſtles and Diſciples of Chriſt preached, when they did by their doctrine conuert Peoples, Landes, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes, &amp;c. Is by that which I haue before written, prooued to bée ſuch doctrine in déede.</p>
               <p>The third point of doctrine, is the deniall of frée will. Héerein alſo, M. Offerer dooth abuſe vs (whom hée calleth Proteſtants.) For no learned Proteſtant either hath, doth, or will deny mans will to be frée, although it may (in ſome ſence) bee affirmed to bee bound. Free it is, bicauſe it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is nor can bee enforced to conſent to any action, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the outward action may bée ſo enforced by violence, that it may be doone or left vndoone, contrary to the inward will of the perſon that either dooth the action, or dooth leaue it vndoone. As when a man falleth into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hands of théeues, and fearing to bée murdered by them, dooth deliuer to them
<pb facs="tcp:11401:15"/> his money, which notwithſtanding, hee is willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine &amp; keepe from them, if with ſaftie of his life hee might doo it. And yet in this caſe, it may bee ſaid, that the will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth to deliuer the money, being drawne (but not enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced) by the conſideration of the hard choiſe, which is eyther to deliuer the money, or to die preſently by the bloody ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of the théeues.</p>
               <p>The queſtion therefore is not; whether the will of man bee free: but whether the powre of mans free will bee ſuch, that it is able of it ſelfe to make choiſe of that which is good and to embrace it: and to refuſe that which is euill, and to ſhunne it. In the ſixt of Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> goſpell, our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt hath ſaide thus: <hi>Nemo potest venire ad me, niſi Pater qui miſit me traherit eum,</hi> No man can come vnto mee, except the Father that ſent mee ſhall drawe him. Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Auguſt. in Ioan. tract. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>In Iohannem. Tract. 26.</hi> writeth thus vpon this place, <hi>Magna gratiae commendatio. Nemo venit niſi tractus. Quem trahat, &amp; quem non trahat: quare illum tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hat, &amp; illum non trahat, noli velle iudicare, ſi non vis errare: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel accede &amp; intellige, &amp;c.</hi> This is a great commendation of grace or frée mercy. No man dooth come without draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. If thou wilt not erre, bee not willing to iudge, whom hee draweth, and whom hee draweth not: why hée draweth one man, and why hee draweth not another: receiue it and vnderſtand it at once. Thou arte not drawne, pray that thou maiſt bee drawne: But heere, what doo wee ſay bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren? If wee bee drawne vnto Chriſt: then doo wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue againſt our willes. Then is not the will ſtirred vp, but violence is vſed. Any man being vnwilling, may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Church, hee may come vnto the aulter, being vnwilling, hee may come vnto the Sacrament, being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing: but beleeue hee can not, except hee bee willing. If beleefe were an act of the body, then might it be doone in them that bee vnwilling: but it is not with the bodie, that wée beléeue vnto Righteouſneſſe.

               <p>By theſe plaine places of Scripture, it appeereth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly, that the learned Proteſtants, doo teach nothing concerning free will, but that which our Sauiour Chriſt, &amp; his Apoſtle <hi>Paule</hi> haue taught.

               <p>The ſame <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> (in his <hi>17.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tom. 4. In Epiſt. ad Heb. hom. 17.</note> Homilie vpon the Epiſtle to the Hebrews) writeth thus, <hi>Nonne per ſingulos dies offerrimus? Offerrimus quidem, ſed ad recordationem fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientes mortis eius. Et vna est haec hostia, non multae. Quomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do vna est &amp; non multae? Quia ſemel oblata est, &amp;c.</hi> Doo not wée offer euery day? In déede, wée doo offer: but wée doo it for a remembrance of his death. And this ſacrifice is but one and not many. And how is it but one and not many? Bicauſe it was offred but once, it was offred in the holieſt place of all: and this ſacrifice (which wée offer) is the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne or example thereof, wée doo alwaies offer one and the ſelfe ſame thing. And after many words to the ſame end: hée ſaith thus, <hi>Non aliud ſacrificium ſicut Pontifex, ſed idipſum ſemper facimus: magis autem recordationem ſacrificij operamur.</hi> Wee offer not another ſacrifice, as the high Prieſt did, but wee doo alwaies make one and the ſame ſacrifice: but wee doo rather worke the remembrance of a ſacrifice.</p>
               <p>Except our Aduerſaries haue vtterly loſt the vſe of Reaſon, they muſt needes ſee, that <hi>Chryſoſtomes</hi> meaning was to teach that it is not the holy <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death and paſſion of Chriſt (whereof the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> is a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce) that is the ſacrifice propitiatorie, whereby our ſinnes are taken away. Euen in the iudgement of <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome,</hi> therefore, the Maſſe (which you call bleſſed) is in
<pb facs="tcp:11401:19"/> deede curſſed, bicauſe it is derogatory to the office of Chriſt Ieſus: whoſe comming into this worlde was to ſaue ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. And hee onely it is, that hath ſaued his people from their ſinns: by making a ſacrifice of him ſelfe once for all. By which one ſacrifice once made, hee hath made perfect as many and bee made holie, that is, all the Elected and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen children of God. So that now there is no more ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for ſinne.<note place="margin">Hebr, 10.</note> As the Apoſtle hath written to the Hebrews, Chapter <hi>10.</hi> But what ſhould I make any more to doo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this matter: ſith the Scripture is plaine on our ſide? <hi>Sit Deus verax,</hi>

               <p>Now, the laſt point of doctrine that you charge the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants with, is the aboliſhing of Chriſtes ſacraments, &amp; of all the graces and goodneſſe by them conferred vnto vs. To this I ſay, that no learned Proteſtant, either hath, doth or will aboliſh, or conſent to the aboliſhing, of any one ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament that our ſauiour Chriſt hath inſtituted, or of any grace or goodnes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ferred to vs by them. Wée confeſſe with S. <hi>Auguſtine. <hi>Ad Ianuarium. Epist.</hi> 118.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Auguſt. ad Ianuarium. 118.</note> that our ſauiour Chriſt hath inſtituted verie fewe ſacraments, and that the ſame are verie effectuall, as is Baptiſme, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the bodie and blood of our ſauiour Chriſt. Theſe two ſacraments wee acknowledge to bee inſtituted by our ſauiour Chriſt, as ſacraments, that is, outward and viſible ſignes, repreſenting inward inuiſible and ſpirituall graces. In Baptiſme, the outward and viſible ſigne is water, and the inward, inuiſible and ſpirituall grace, is forgiuenes of ſinnes, and regeneration or new byrth: both which we haue by the death and reſurrection of Chriſt, and in that ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wee receiue a ſeale and pledge of the ſame. Yea, and where wee are by nature the children of Gods wrath: wee are by Baptiſme, receiued into the church, and aſſured that wee are now the children of God, ioyned and graffed into the bodie of Chriſt, and are become his members, and that wee doo grow into one bodie with him. Yea, and being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that Gods couenant and promiſe made to faithfull <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:11401:19"/> and to his ſeede, belongeth to vs and to our ſeede, bicauſe (belieuing in Chriſt) wee bee the ſpirituall poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of <hi>Abraham:</hi> wée are bould to baptiſe our children, as fellow members togither with vs, of the ſame myſtical bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of Chriſt, that it hath pleaſed our heauenly Father to make vs members of, And when they bee able to learne, wee doo teach them to belieue and acknowledge that they bee ſo: and to endeuour in their life to expreſſe that duetie both to God and man, which was at their baptiſme profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and promiſed.</p>
               <p>In the other ſacrament (which we doo commonly call the Lords ſupper) the outward and viſible ſigne is breade and wine, both which wee doo (according to Chriſtes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement) receiue. For hee hath ſaid Take, eate, this is my bodie: and drinke yee all of this: for this is the Cup of the new teſtament in my blood, &amp;c. And wee are aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Faith: that as wee doo receiue the breade and wine into our mouthes and ſtomacks, euen ſo wee doo by faith, receiue into our ſoules, the very body and blood of Chryſt, that heauenly foode, whereby our ſoules are refreſhed and fed vnto euerlaſting life. And this bodie &amp; blood of Chriſt, are the heauenly parte of this ſacrament, remooued from all outward ſenſes.</p>
               <p>But wée doo not belieue (as you popiſh Catholiques would haue vs belieue) that the ſubſtance of the bread and wine in this ſacrament, is turned into the ſubſtance of the bodie and blood of Chriſt: for ſo it could not bee a ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which muſt haue in it both an outward and viſible ſigne, and an inward inuiſible grace. Wherefore the bread and wine muſt remaine in their natures and properties.</p>
               <p>Neither doo wée belieue, that this ſacrament was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined to bee a ſacrifice to God the father, for the remiſſion of ſinnes: for wee know that onely Chriſt Ieſus hath bin and is able and worthy to offer ſacrifice for the deliuerance of mankinde from ſinne. And that hee hath (by that ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice that hee made of himſelfe, once for all) fully ſatiſfied
<pb facs="tcp:11401:20"/> for the ſinnes of the whole world, and hath left nothing for vs to doo, but firmely to fixe our faith in him, and thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to take the vſe of this eternall ſacrifice, which wee chiefly doo, when wee come worthely to the Lords table, &amp; bee partakers of that holy ſacrament.</p>
               <p>Now, if you thinke that I haue doone that which you required the learned Proteſtant to doo: then ſhame not to yeelde and recant, and bee no longer an obſtinate and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full blinde popiſh Catholique, which is an Antichriſtian ſchiſmaticke. But bee a tractable and an obedient Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of Chriſt Ieſus, hearkening to, and belieuing the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of Chriſt, which is the glad tidings of free pardon and full forgiuenes of all our ſinnes by the merites and media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our onely Lord and ſauiour Ieſus Chriſt, proteſting to hold euerie goſpell that is contrary to this Goſpell, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed, as ſaint <hi>Paule</hi> willed the Galathians to doo. So ſhall you bee a right Catholique Chriſtian, holding and profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that Catholique faith, which Chriſt himſelfe comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his meſſengers to teach Catholiquely, when hee ſayde thus, <hi>Euntes in mundum vniuerſum, docete omnes gentes, bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizantes eos in nomine patris,</hi>

This is the Catholique doctrine that wee haue heard and learned, and doo belieue it. By hearing this woord of the goſpell or glad tidings of free pardon and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe of ſinnes: our God hath wrought in vs ſuch an aſſurance of Saluation, that wee doubt nothing thereof. And this aſſuraunce woorketh in vs an vnfayned loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him that hath adopted, predeſtinated, and called vs to bee meete Images of his ſonne: and one of vs towards another, although not in ſuch perfection as hee hath loued vs, and as hée commaundeth vs to loue one another, yet in ſome meaſure, and in ſuch meaſure as hee in mercie allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of. Wee proteſt therefore, that wee will hold this faith

As for workes diuiſed by men: wee eſteeme of them as wee finde them. If wee ſée that they bend to the ſetting foorth of Gods glory, in our edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wee vſe them, otherwiſe wee refuſe them. But the workes that God hath commaunded: wee are carefull to doo. And when by the infirmitie and corruption of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, wee ſtumble and fall: wée crie vnto our mercifull fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for help, as being aſſured that hee heareth vs and in tender affection towards vs, will help vs: yea, though hee doo for a time ſuffer vs to lie vnder that too too heauie bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of ſinne, vnder which wée are fallen by infirmitie. Wee ſeeke not to our fellow ſeruants, as to Angels or men: much leſſe to Antichriſt, the profeſſed enimie of our Chriſt and ſauiour.

When therefore the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Proteſtants, ſhalbe able to bring proofe to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, that their priuate conuenticles and Congregations, were the firſt bringers forth of this ſacred Bible and word of God written, the chiefe preſeruers and defenders of the ſame in all times and ages, from all Iewes, Gentiles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes and ſchiſmatikes: then will I, as I ſayd before, reuolt and recant.</p>
               <p>Crowley.</p>
               <p>In this his ſecond Offer, the Offerer vſeth a fallace or diſceit, which in reaſoning is called, <hi>Petitio principij,</hi> That is, hee laboureth to confirme his aſſertion, wherein there is no certenty, by that wherein there is, as litle or leſſe certenty) then in that aſſertion that hee holdeth.

               <p>His aſſertion is, that the Church of Rome (which he calleth Catholique) is and euer hath bin, from time to time the conſeruer and kéeper of the ſacred ſcriptures: and this hee would prooue by another like aſſertion, that is, that the ſame Church was the firſt Preacher and Writer of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame ſcripture, which hée calleth the ſacred Bible and holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>When the vnlearned Reader conſidereth this aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: hée is brought into ſuch a maze, that hee knoweth not which way to take. For this Offerer would beare him in hand, that the ſacred Bible, which containeth thoſe bookes that are called the old Teſtament: were neuer written be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:11401:21"/> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church which he calleth Catholike did take in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to write them. Where as in very déede, ſome of thoſe bookes were written, before the firſt foundation of Rome was layde. Yea, hee would that men ſhould thinke, that, that Romiſh Church which hée calleth Catholique: is the ſame that was firſt planted amongſt the Nations of the worlde, by the preaching of the goſpell amongſt them. Which prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching began at Hieruſalem, &amp; ſprang from thence, as from a moſt plentifull Fountaine, and was by the labour and trauell of the Apoſtles and Diſciples of our ſauiour Chriſt, in preaching the goſpell ſpeedily ſpred ouer all the worlde. And that it was this Romiſh Church that did firſt wryte the Goſpels and other bookes of the new Teſtament, and hath diſcerned of thoſe bookes that are accounted for holy ſcripture, and hath ſeuered them from all other writinges, what ſo euer: and hath preſerued them from all corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But ſuch as bee learned doo know, that all the bookes of the old Teſtament (commonly called the Bible) were written before the Incarnation of our ſauiour Chriſt: and therefore, before any ſuch Church as this Offerer imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the Romiſh Catholique Church to bée, could haue any being.

               <p>By all theſe places of ſcripture, it appeareth plainely, that the ſacred Bible was written before the Romiſh Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church had hir beginning: and therefore coulde not bée firſt written by that Church, as this Offerer labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to perſwade that it was.</p>
               <p>Yea, and the bookes of the new teſtament, were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the Euangeliſts, and Apoſtles, and not by any ſuch Biſhops and Prieſts, as this Offerer would haue vs think to bée the immediate ſucceſſors of the Apoſtles and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of our ſauiour Chriſt, and to bée the Biſhops &amp; Prieſts of the City of Rome. For when ſaint <hi>Paule</hi> being in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon at Rome, wrote his ſecond Epiſtle to <hi>Timothie:</hi> there were no ſuch Biſhops or Prieſtes there, as might worthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bee taken for Chriſtians.

               <p>If this Offerer &amp; his fellowes, haue any eyes to ſée, they may ſée: that when the Apoſtle <hi>Paule</hi> (being in priſon in Rome) did write this Epiſtle to <hi>Timoth.</hi> the Biſhops and prieſts y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> then were in Rome, were ſcarce worthy the name of Chriſtians, bicauſe they durſt not ſtand to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> profeſſion of Chriſtian Religion as S. <hi>Paule</hi> did, but left him all alone, betraying the Chriſtian cauſe, as much as in them lay.</p>
               <p>Yea, and hereof it may bée probably gathered: that <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> was not then at Rome, and conſequently that hee was not Biſhop of Rome for the ſpace of xxv. yéeres togither, as the Romiſh Catholiques doo affirme that hee was. Yea, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it may bée thought y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee neuer was Biſhop of Rome: for this Epiſtle was written in Rome, the <hi>13.</hi> yeere of the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:11401:22"/> raigne of <hi>Nero,</hi> which was the <hi>35.</hi> yeere after ſaint <hi>Paule</hi> was conuerted to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But if hee were then Biſhop of Rome, hée was at that time either fled from Rome, fearing the perſecution, or els being in that Citie, hée durſt not ſhew him ſelfe to bée of one minde with <hi>Paule,</hi> and ſo by his example, the reſt that then were Chriſtians in Rome, withdrew them ſelues from <hi>Paule,</hi> and left him all alone.</p>
               <p>Thirteene yeeres before this, the Apoſtle <hi>Paule</hi> had written to the Romaines, being then at Corinth, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> laſt yeere of the raigne of <hi>Claudius</hi> the Emperour. And as it appeareth in the firſt Chapter of that Epiſtle: the fame of that Church was ſuch at that time, that ſaint <hi>Paule</hi> wrote thus, <hi>Primum quidem gratias ago Deo meo,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 1,</note> 
                  <hi>per Ieſum Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stum, pro omnibus vobis, quia fides vestra annuntiatur in vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſo mundo.</hi> Firſt of all, I giue thankes to my God, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough Ieſus Chriſt, on the behalfe of you all: for that your faith is declared through out the whole world. The Church therefore, or Congregation of Chriſtians that then were in Rome, were of the beſt ſort of Chriſtians. And bicauſe that Citie was then the chiefe City that then was in the world: therefore the fame of their faith was ſpred ouer all the world. But yet (as appeareth by that which is before alleaged) they had their faults and infirmities, which were ſeene in them more at one time then at another. At the firſt, when they receiued y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine of the goſpell, they were earneſt profeſſors and followers of the ſame (as common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men haue bin in our daies, and are ſtill) but when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution began to ariſe for the profeſſing thereof: they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſhew them ſelues to bee like that ſeede that being ſowne, fell in ſtony ground, and yet being againe moyſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> dew of Gods grace which fell from aboue, they tooke déepe roote, and ſo became more fruitfull in the ende. For many of that age gaue their liues for the teſtimony of the truth, and were Martirs or witneſſes of Ieſus Chriſt, as in the Church Hiſtories dooth appeere.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:11401:23"/>
               <p>But that theſe were the writers of the Scriptures, appeareth not in any Hiſtories, for they were written be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſome by the Prophets, and ſome by the Apoſtles: and ſuch bookes as were written after the time wherein the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Apoſtles liued, were written by the Apoſtle <hi>Iohn,</hi> which liued after all the reſt.</p>
               <p>As touching the eſpeciall care that you ſay the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church hath from time to time had, not only of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the word, but alſo of preſeruing the ſame, &amp;c: all lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Proteſtants doo know, that no man could haue greater care to preach the woord, to diſcerne the bookes of holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, from prophane writings, and to preſerue them from the corruption of the aduerſaries, then they that in the time of the tenne firſt perſecutions, profeſſed the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique religion. And amongſt thoſe Catholiques: none were more forwarde therein, then were they, which then were dwelling in the City of Rome. But what maketh this for proofe, that the Romiſh Church hath alwaies bin, and is ſtill, the keeper and preſeruer of the ſcriptures? The firſt Romiſh Church (which was Catholique) preached the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, as the Apoſtles and Diſciples of Chriſt had doone: but that Romiſh church that now is, and hath bin for the ſpace of theſe laſt thouſand yéeres (almoſt) being Antichriſtian, dooth, and hath all this while preached mens traditions, &amp; is to bee noted with that ſaying that the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, in reprehending the Leuiticall Prieſtes of his time. <hi>Eſay. 29.</hi>

               <p>The firſt Romiſh Church, vſed the Sacraments that Chriſt had inſtituted, religiouſly, and to that end that our ſauiour Chriſt had inſtituted them for: but that Romiſhe Church, which you call Catholique, hath for the ſpace of

For that Church dooth miniſter that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to Churches, to Belles, and to Ships that ſaile on the ſeas: and of the other ſacrament they make an Idole, lifting it vp ouer their heads to bee worſhipped, ſetting it vpon their high alter, or hanging it ouer the ſame, burning incenſe before it, and vſing ieſtures of diuine honour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, and carying it abroade in pompous maner, compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the people to doo diuine honour to it. Yea, they offer it vp to God as a ſacrifice for the ſinnes both of the quick &amp; the dead: and in tempeſts of weather, and in coniurations, they make it a bug to feare the diuell withall.</p>
               <p>The firſt Catholique Church, in their exerciſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, did vſe as few Ceremonies as might bee: for they knew that our ſauiour Chriſt had broken downe that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle walle or particion, which was the lawe of Ceremonies contayned in the lawe written, and had (through the fleſh) bin the occaſion that diſcord, whereby the nations of the worlde were ſo ſeuered from the people of Iſraell that they could neuer ioyne with them in one religion, till our ſauiour Chriſt had made it voyde, and made of both the peoples but one new man, making peace, that he might reconcile both in one body. And <hi>Ephe. 2.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ephe. 2.</note> But your Romiſh Catholique Church, hath reedified a new middle walle or particion, of a law of Ceremonies, not contayned in the law written, but diuiſed by men. And that particion they doo ſtill maintaine and vphold, enforcing all men that will beare the name of Chriſt and bée called Chriſtians to allow of and to vſe thoſe Ceremonies: and all ſuch as doo refuſe thoſe Ceremonies, they doo excommunicate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer to the ſecular powre to bée conſumed to aſhes with fire, or otherwiſe to bée tormented, onely bicauſe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to vſe thoſe Ceremonies.</p>

                  <note place="margin">1.

Such Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces dooth your Pope take vpon him to depoſe, &amp; to depriue them of all princely dignitie, &amp; to ſet vp in their place, ſuch as will ſubmit them ſelues vnto him, &amp; become his ſworne vaſſalles. And that he may y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more eaſily bring theſe things to paſſe: hée abſolueth all the ſubiects of ſuch Princes from their dutifull oth of obedience, which they haue dutifully taken to thoſe their leage and naturall Princes.

               <p>By theſe differences, it apreareth how great the difference is betwixt the firſt Romiſh church (which was in déede Catholique) and yours, which you call catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:11401:24"/> but is in déede Cacolike.</p>
               <p>But now you conclude, that if the learned Proteſtant can prooue, that the priuate conuenticles &amp; congregations of the Proteſtants, were the firſt bringers foorth of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Bible and written woord of God, the chiefe preſeruers and defenders of the ſame, in all times and ages, from all Iewes, Gentiles, Heretikes and ſchiſmatiks: then you wil reuolt, and recant as you haue ſaide before.</p>
               <p>To this I ſay (on the behalfe of the learned Proteſtant) that neither the Catholique church, nor any other congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, haue bin the firſt bringers foorth of the ſacred Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, &amp;c. For thoſe bookes which are called the Bible, were brought foorth and written, before our ſauiour Chriſt ſayd thus to the Iewes. <hi>Scrutamini ſcripturas, &amp;c. <hi>Ioh. 5.</hi>

The Iewes could neuer corrupt the text of the Canonicall ſcriptures: although they lacked no good will to haue corrupted them. Neither could your Popiſh catholiques at any time cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt thoſe ſcripcures: for God hath reſerued a Remnant of the Iewes, with whom thoſe ſcriptures are (and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies haue bin) had in ſuch eſtimation, and reuerence, that they would neuer leaue them to any that would corrupt them, and this hath God wrought by them, vſing them as his inſtruments therein. In like manner, the Grecians
<pb facs="tcp:11401:25"/> haue bin his inſtruments, in kéeping the Gréeke text, both of the olde and newe teſtament, from all manner of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, in all partes thereof that doo concerne any parte of the ſubſtance of our Religion: ſo that though your Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Catholiques would (as no doubt they are willing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough) yet they can not corrupt either the Hebrew or Gréeke text.</p>
               <p>Thus (if you will) you may ſée (maiſter Offerer) that God alone, by ſuch meanes as hée hath, dooth, and will vſe, hath bin the bringer foorth of the ſacred Bible, and other holy ſcriptures: for the holy men of God did ſpeake, as the holy ſpirite of God did mooue them to ſpeake. <hi>2.

               <p>It is very true, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the knowne Catholike church hath bin, and ſtill is, as for theſe fiftéene hundreth yéeres laſt paſt; it hath bin, the meane that God hath vſed, in the conuinſing &amp; ouerthrowing of <hi>Arians, Neſtorians,</hi> and the reſt of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes that you ſpeake of. It is moſt true alſo, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſame Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike church hath all this time, continued firme and ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt: but how can you prooue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> your popiſh Catholike church is that knowne Catholike church of Chriſt, that you ſpeake of? Héerein lieth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> difficulty. It is not enough for you to ſay, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> your romiſh church is the Catholike church: but you muſt prooue it. Your antiquity, your vniuerſality, &amp; your v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, with your continuall ſucceſſion of Biſhops, will not ſerue your turne.</p>
               <p>Your antiquity is not ſo auncient as ours by 4600. yéeres (almoſt.) For ours began in <hi>Adam,</hi> &amp; hath continued euer ſince: &amp; yours began to floriſh in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> daies of <hi>Phocas</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> murdred <hi>Mauricius,</hi> &amp; his wife and children, &amp; was the firſt that gaue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> title of vniuerſall biſhop, to <hi>Bonifacius</hi> the 3. then biſhop of Rome. And this was 600. yéeres after the birth of our ſauiour Chriſt. Your church was in hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the later 300. yéeres of the 600. but neuer perfected be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Phocas</hi> time, Wherefore your antiquity is nothing.</p>
               <p>Your vniuerſalitie was neuer ſo large as the Romain Empire, your vnity diuided, into moe ſects then euer the
<pb facs="tcp:11401:29"/> heathen Philoſophers were. Your ſucceſſion of Biſhops, is ſuch that no man can iuſtly prooue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi> was the firſt, nor that euer hee was Biſhop of Rome. Or if hée were Biſhop of Rome, no man can certainely ſay how longe he was there Biſhop, nor who it was that was the next Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop after him. And by the teſtimony of your owne Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians: ſome in the ſucceſſion of your Biſhops, were as wicked men as euer liued vpon earth: and one was a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, &amp; an arrant whore. And biſides all this: your Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolike ſeate of Rome that you bragge ſo much of, hath bin voyde, for the ſpace of one, yea, two yeeres togither &amp; more. You haue had alſo, two: yea, three Popes at one time, and much blood hath bin ſhed about the triall of their titles.</p>
               <p>But our vniuerſality is (and euer hath bin) as large as the whole world: yea, when in the iudgement of men of the beſt ſorte, our Church ſeemed to bée cleane rooted out, as in the daies of king <hi>Achab</hi> it ſéemed to bée in the kingdome of Iſraell: yet had God his number knowne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, although not knowne vnto men. And therefore, when <hi>Elias</hi> complayned, and ſaid, The children of Iſraell haue forſaken thy couenant, they haue ouerthrowne thine alter, they haue ſlaine thy prophets, I alone doo remaine, and they ſeeke after my life. 3. <hi>Reg.</hi> 19.<note place="margin">3.

And this church hath God made able at all times, to conuince all hereſies and Heretikes.

               <p>Our ſucceſſion of Biſhops, is ſuch as the ſucceſſion of the Prophets was. We make no account of that ſucceſſion of Biſhops in Rome, which you doo bragge ſo much of (for the Scribes and Phariſies might haue bragged of ſuch a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion as well as you doo, and might haue ſayd to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt as you do to vs, where was your Goſpel 400. yéeres paſt?) But we doo make account of that ſucceſſion wherein God hath in his good times, ſtirred vp ſome in the ſpirite of <hi>Elias,</hi> to deale in doctrine with men of all ſortes: as <hi>Elias</hi> dyd with <hi>Achab,</hi> and the Iſralities, and as <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> dyd with <hi>Herode,</hi> and with the Iewes in his time. The high Préeſtes had theyr ſucceſſion euen from <hi>Aaron,</hi> as your Popes haue had from <hi>Peter:</hi> ſome of them aſſpiring to that eſtate by one ſiniſter meane and ſome by an other, as by the Hiſtories it appeareth. But in the meane while, God ſtirred vp Prophets but now and then: for the worde of God was precious in the dayes of <hi>Elie</hi> the high Préeſt, when the Lord ſtirred vp <hi>Samuel</hi> to bee a Prophet. And when <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> was ſtirred vp: there had béene no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet amongſt the Iewes, for the ſpace of many yéeres to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. This was the execution of Gods iuſt iudgement vpon the Iewes, becauſe they had not regarded thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets which he had ſtyrred vp amongſt them. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, in the time that hath béene ſince the Incarnation of
<pb facs="tcp:11401:30"/> our Sauiour Chriſt, becauſe men had giuen ouer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to beleeue lies, &amp; did not regard the trueth.

Yea béeing wilfully blinde: hee gaue them blinde guides that might leade them the right way into the ditch of diſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Thus you may ſée, if you haue a luſt to behold the truth: that not your new found Popiſh Catholique Church, but our moſt auncient Chriſtian Catholique Church, is that Church that hath continued thoroughout firme and ſtedfaſt whiles all other couenticles and congregations aſwell of Arians. &amp;c, as of Mahumetans and Popiſh Antichriſtians, and the reſt of Heretickes of all ſortes, haue decayed and béene conuinced, and ouerthrowne, and that by none other Church, then by the knowne Catholique Church of Chriſt, builded vpon the rocke Chriſt, which <hi>Peter</hi> confeſſed. <hi>Math.</hi> 16.<note place="margin">Math. 16.</note> And vpon none other foundation.

Your ſolemne and pompous proceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, about your Churches and churchyardes wéekely, and about your pariſhes yéerely: are goodly obſeruations.

               <p>Surely, ſuch as doo ſo take my meaning, doo not take it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe: for what reaſon is there to mooue a man, to applie this Epitheton (goodly) in the right ſence thereof, to theſe (&amp; ſuch other) ceremonies and obſeruations, wherein there is nothing, that rightly may be called, either good, or goodlye? We are contented therefore, that your Popiſh Catholique Church, doo take to her ſelfe, the whole praiſe and commen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dation, that the inuention of theſe goodly ceremonies and obſeruations, hath or can deſerue. Yea, we would be verie

               <p>As for the feaſtes of Eaſter and Whitſontyde, we know that God him ſelfe dyd firſt inſtitute them, the one (namely Eaſter) in the remembraunce of the deliueraunce of the people of Iſraell out of Egipt: and the other (that is Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſontyde, or Pentecoſt) in the remembraunce of the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of the Lawe in the mount Sinaie. Whych as they were remembraunces of thinges then paſt: ſo they were fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures or ſhadowes of thinges then to come, and now alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die fulfilled, in the death and reſurrection of our Sauiour Chriſt, and in the ſending of the holy Ghoſt, vpon the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, the fifteth day after the reſurrection of our Sauiour Chriſt. And we are perſwaded that theſe two feaſtes were obſerued euen by the Apoſtles themſelues, in remembe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce of our deliuerance which we haue by the death and reſurrection of our Sauiour Chriſt: and of the comming of the holy Ghoſt, which reſted vpon the Apoſtles, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forme of firie tongues deuided. Yea, and we doo thinke, that the Saboth or the Lordes day, commonly called the Sonday, was obſerued by the Apoſtles: yea and that ſhortly after the tyme of the Apoſtles, the right catholique Chriſtians began to obſerue yéerely, certaine dayes in the remembe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce of holy men which had ſuffered for the teſtimonie of Chriſt: and ſome dayes in the remembraunce of thoſe great and ineſtimable benifits that God hath beſtowed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mankinde, in the incarnation, natiuity, Epiphanie, and Aſcention of our Sauiour Chriſt. But there is no cauſe to mooue vs to thinke, that eyther the Apoſtles, or the fathers dyd iuſtitute thoſe feaſtes, as obſeruations neceſſarie to bée obſerued for euer, but as profitable remembraunces wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> congregations of Chriſt might be mooued to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to God, and encouraged to followe the good examples of thoſe good men, whoſe remembraunces they dyd ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſe. And after this manner, and for this purpoſe, wee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:11401:31"/> doo obſerue ſome of thoſe ſeaſtiuall dayes. Not hauing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuperſtition in the holines of the times, neither beeing perſwaded that we doo deſerue any thing at Gods hand by the obſeruing of the times, or that we ſhould ſinne againſt God, if by a common conſent we ſhould abrogate the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of thoſe times, or by ſome priuate or vrgent occaſion imploy thoſe tymes in our honeſt and neceſſarie buſineſſes.

               <p>And as touching faſting, we obſerue Lent, the Ember dayes, the Fridayes and Saterdayes in euerie wéeke, and the vigilles of ſaintes: but not as you doo, ſuperſtitiouſly, but for good policie. We doo not account one meate holyer then another, neither one time better then another: But we abſtaine from certaine kindes of meates at certayne tymes, that thereby the common weale of our countrie may be bettered. And would to God, al would obſerue that policie more preciſely then any of vs dooth. As touching our own perſons: we do not thinke our ſelues to be either y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bet<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter or the wurſſe, by taking or leauing of the vſe of Gods creatures.<note place="margin">Rom, 14,</note> But according to S. <hi>Paules</hi> rule to the Romans Capit 14.

               <p>It is God himſelfe that hath preſcribed an order of diſcipline, and hath in all tymes and ages committed the execution thereof to hys Church, which hath had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce euen from the beginning of the world.

               <p>That diſcipline that you make ſo great a reckoning of, is your cannon lawe (I am ſure) which your Popes haue patched together ſince they gate the vpper hand, and enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Princes to doo them ſeruice and to kyſſe their féete.

               <p>If the Offerer will ſay that thoſe Martirs, &amp;c. did obſerue and kéepe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> religion, and did performe in déede that which they did profeſſe, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they were in déede vnſpotted of thys world, (which none of vs dooth,) then I muſt ſay, that they all did ſay, as all we doo ſay, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> hath writ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ten <hi>Pſa. 143.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>As for your approouing and cannonizing of theſe Martirs &amp;c. Whereby you haue made them ſaintes after they were departed out of this lyfe: it may well be compared to the building and garniſhing of the Tombes of the Prophets, by the Scribes and Phariſeis <hi>Math, 23.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Math. 23.</note> For although you pretende to haue a reuerend care for the kéeping of the wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thy and valiant acts of thoſe Martirs in remembrance: yet you doo daily murder as many of that ſorte of men, as God wyll ſuffer you to haue power ouer, and ſo you ſhew your ſelues to be the children of thoſe bloody Tyrants that mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered thoſe Martyrs that you ſpeake of.</p>
               <p>I thinke you can not but ſee now that all the thouſandes of Martyrs, confeſſors and virgins, that were brought forth in the firſt ſixe hundreth yéeres next after the aſcention of our Sauiour Chriſt: were the children of that Mother (the holy Catholique Church of Chriſt) that hath brought foorth and nouriſhed vp vs, whome you call Schiſmatickes and Heretickes.</p>
               <p>But now I pray you (good M. Offerer) let mee learne of you, the name of one Martir, that your mother, (the Popiſh Catholique Church) hath brought forth ſince the dayes of <hi>Boniface</hi> the thyrd, which was the time wherein your Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacie beganne. I thinke you can not name me one Martyr that hath béene brought foorth by that mother of yours, in all that time, which is (almoſt) the ſpace of a thouſande yéeres. Not one (I am ſure) of all your Popes that haue ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeded that <hi>Bonifacius</hi> hath béene made a Martyr: excepte you account for martirdome, the poiſoning of ſome of them which hath béene doone by ſome ſuch as themſelues, that haue haſted to be in theyr place.

               <p>Yea it appeareth manifeſtly, that the whole ſtate of your Popiſh Catholique Church, hath béene and ſtill is, none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, but that which was figured by that two horned Beaſt that roſe out of the earth, of whom mencion is made in the <hi>13.</hi> Chap of the Reuelations.

               <p>Amongſt your Popes, very few or none can bée founde, that haue held the religion of <hi>Peter,</hi> &amp; walked in his ſteps. Your <hi>Boniface</hi> the third (which was the firſt of your Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatat Popes) ſhewed him ſelfe to bée of a far other minde then <hi>Peter</hi> was: otherwiſe, hee would neuer haue ſought for, and with great contention haue obtained that name of vniuerſall Biſhop, which <hi>Gregorie</hi> the firſt refuſed as a prophane name, and a ſigne of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fore runner of Antichriſt. This would haue bin a luſty lad, if hee might haue conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in the eſtate of a Pope, many yéeres: but hée was cut of by death, in the ninth moneth after hee was made Pope. The reſt that haue ſucceeded (euen vntill this day) haue in one point walked in the ſteps of this <hi>Bonifacius:</hi> for they all haue taken vpon them and kept the title of vniuerſall Biſhop, and ſo dooth hee that dooth now enioy that place. And ſo (by good conſequence) it may bee ſaid, that they are all Antichriſtian,</p>
               <p>But to returne to our purpoſe. That church whereof the Proteſtants bee members, hath had Apoſtles as longe time as th'office of an Apoſtle was neceſſary for hir. In like maner ſhee hath had Prophets of both ſortes. Euangeliſts alſo ſhee hath had, and hath ſtill, whoſe office is to water that which the Apoſtles haue planted. Of this ſorte was <hi>Timoth.</hi> and ſo was <hi>Apollos,</hi> and others that were when they were, and in the firſt 600. yeeres after Chriſts aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And ſuch bee they in theſe dayes which are able to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct, and doo labour to inſtruct Chriſtians how to leade a chriſtian life, and to bee aſſured of Saluation, onely by the mediation of Chriſt Ieſus, that promiſed Seede, through whom, all the nations of the world are promiſed to be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and bleſſed.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:11401:38"/>
               <p>Paſtors and doctors alſo, our Church hath alwaies had, and now hath: The Popes catholiques neuer had the like. Theſe are they that God hath made able to breake y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> breade of life, to the flocke of Chriſt, and to teach &amp; inſtruct them in all neceſſary knowledge to ſaluation. And theſe (as the others) are made able &amp; ſtirred vp to worke in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lords Harueſt, by him that (as oft as néede is) ſendeth forth labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers into his Harueſt.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall &amp; orderly ſucceſſion, but when it pleaſeth him to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the vnthankfulnes of his people, by taking from them ſuch as hee hath made méete and able to execute theſe offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces amongſt them, hee may, and in iuſtice hée dooth. That ſo his people may learne to vſe ſuch good gifts better, when they ſhall againe enioy them.</p>
               <p>And as for that popiſh-Catholique church, which your ſort doo call the knowne Catholique church: neuer had ſuch Apoſtles, Prophets, Euangeliſts, Paſtors and Doctors, as S. <hi>Paule</hi> ment of in his writing to the <hi>Epheſ.</hi> For that Church was not hatched before the dayes of <hi>Boniface</hi> the third. And therefore that church neither had nor could haue any ſuch Apoſtles, Prophets, or Euangeliſts as our church had in the ſix hundreth yeeres next after the aſcention of our ſauiour.</p>
               <p>I conclude therefore, that neither our Church (which is the right Catholique church) nor yours (which is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> right Antichriſtian church) hath had any ſuch continuall and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly ſucceſſion, as you require the Proteſtant to prooue by the Eccleſiaſticall hyſtories.

               <p>If ſuch as bée of the learned ſorte amongſt them that be of the Romiſh Catholique church, would with humbled mindes reade this booke of Reuelations, &amp; ſéeke for the true fence &amp; meaning but of this one viſion: vndoubtedly they ſhould finde (and I hope they would confeſſe) that the true Catholike church of Chriſt, that was figured by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> woman: had not the glory of the world, as the Romiſh Catholique church hath now, but was in this world obſcure, and after a ſorte, hid from the preſence, of ſuch as the ſerpent had ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp to perſecute hir, which were the mighty Emperors, and other y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were of great powre within the Romaine Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. And yet was ſhée ſtill clad with the ſunne, &amp; had the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:11401:39"/> Moone vnder hir féete, &amp;c. That is, ſhée was ſtill glorious in the ſight of God and of all good men.

Yea, and ſhée had hir head crowned with the twelue ſtarres, the Patriarches which were Fathers to the twelue kinreds of Iſraell, or thoſe twelue Meſſengers, or Apoſtles, which our ſauiour Chriſt had ſent foorth, as ſtarres to giue light in the darknes of this world.</p>
               <p>Yea, although ſhee dwelt ſtill in Rome, &amp; in other Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that belonged to the Romaine Empire: yet ſhee was as in a wildernes, as hauing nothing, and yet poſſeſſing all things, &amp;c. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.<note place="margin">2, Cor, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>If the Catholique church might haue hir Apoſtles, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Euangeliſts, Paſtors, and Doctors (as vndoubtedly ſhee had) in the time of the firſt bloody perſecutions, which continued for the ſpace of 294. yeeres almoſt continually: why might ſhee not haue ſo many of thoſe miniſters as were neceſſarie for hir edification, during the time of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter perſecution which hath continued how almoſt a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeeres togithers?

               <p>This Offerer minding vtterly to diſcredit the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants hath with his pen teſtified for them, that they doo al agree in this one point, which is, that their Congregation, Faith, and Religion, haue bin practized in the Primatiue church of Chriſt. But here hée thinketh to diſcredit them all. Some of them (as <hi>Iohn Caluin,</hi> doo affirme that this was for the ſpace of the firſt thrée hundreth yéeres, ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (as <hi>Martin Luther</hi> and his complices) for the ſpace of foure or fiue hundreth yéeres, and ſome others (as M. <hi>Iewell</hi> and the authors of the Apologie of the Church of England) for the whole ſpace of the firſt fixe hundreth yéeres, &amp;c.

If <hi>Caluin</hi> had ſaid, that the Church whereof wée bée, had continuance for no longer time then the firſt thrée hundreth yéeres, where <hi>Luther</hi> had ſaid before, that it had continuance for the ſpace of foure, or fiue hundreth yéeres: And M. <hi>Iewell,</hi> comming after them both ſhould haue ſaid, the continuance was for the ſpace of the firſt ſixe hundreth yéeres, in ſuch perfection as in the firſt thrée hundreth yéeres: then this Offerer might haue taken ſome oecaſion to note diſagréement, ſuch as is to bée ſéene amongſt Heretikes. But now, hée hath no iuſt occaſion at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caluin</hi> conſidered, that during the time of the firſt <hi>300.</hi> yeeres, the Church of Chriſt was ſtill vnder tyrants,

               <p>But this Offerer requireth ſome better ſtaied &amp; certaine tale, &amp;c. bicauſe <hi>Luther</hi> and other doo differ from <hi>Caluin.</hi> He muſt know where &amp; when this ſodaine change from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants religion to the papiſts was made, as in what yéere of our Lord, &amp;c.

But the doctrine of the goſpell which they preached was not ſo regarded in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> city of Rome as it ſhould haue bin, &amp; as it ſéemeth that this Offerer and his fellowes bée perſuaded that it was, at that time, wherein ſaint <hi>Paule</hi> was brought priſoner to Rome: which was in the tenth yeere of the raigne of <hi>Nero,</hi> &amp; but foure yéeres before S. <hi>Paule</hi> ended his life. At that time, the chiefe amongſt the Iewes that then liued in Rome, being called togither by S. <hi>Paule,</hi> and being occaſioned by him to ſpeake of the chriſtian Religion, they ſaid thus. Wee are willing to heare of thee what thine opinion is: for we doo know, that this ſect, is euery where ſpoken againſt. <hi>Act. 28</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act, 28,</note> Yea, and when S. <hi>Paule</hi> was firſt called to his anſwere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Emperor: the Chriſtians then in Rome, were ſo faint hearted, that they did leaue him alone, as he him ſelfe hath written to <hi>Timoth. 2.

                  <hi>In prima mea defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſione, nemo mihi affuit, ſed omnes dereliquerunt me: non illis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putetur, &amp;c.</hi> In my firſt defence, no man did take part with mee, but all did forſake mee: God grant that it bee not laid to their charge: but the Lord did aſſiſt &amp; ſtrengthen me, &amp;c. And this was more then thirty yeeres after our Sauiour Chriſt had ſent foorth his Apoſtles to preach.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Peter</hi> were biſhop of Rome at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time that S. <hi>Paule</hi> ſpeaketh of in that <hi>4. Cap. 2.

And S. <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith that all did forſake him.</p>
               <p>But let this paſſe. The eſtate of the whole Church was no better in thoſe daies: yea, it was not much better at any time, during the firſt <hi>300.</hi> yeeres after Chriſtes aſcention. For when <hi>Conſtantinus</hi> the firſt chriſtian Emperor, began his raigne: <hi>Sylueſter,</hi> then biſhop of Rome, had not his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boade then in Rome, but made his dwelling place in ſome
<pb facs="tcp:11401:42"/> caue in a mountaine named <hi>Soracte,</hi> xx. myles diſtant from Rome, that ſo hée might bée more ſafe from the tyrannie of the Romaine Emperor. But when hee vnderſtoode that <hi>Conſtantinus,</hi> was likely to bee fauorable to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Chriſtians: hée repaired to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> City. By this it may appeare, of what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the Romaine biſhops had bin, &amp; what publike &amp; open preaching of the goſpell there had bin, in the City of Rome during that time of the firſt <hi>300.</hi> yeeres.</p>
               <p>It appeereth in Hyſtories, that they had their places wherein they met, and had the preaching of the woorde &amp; miniſtration of the Sacraments: but thoſe places were not ſuch as Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Church, which is now in Rome. For that Church, with the reſt of the Churches in Rome, were not then builded, as in <hi>Platina,</hi> and in other Hyſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries it appeereth.</p>
               <p>By this, you may ſee what cauſe <hi>Caluin</hi> had to ſay that the Catholique Religion (which is the ſame that wee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants doo now profeſſe) was practized for the ſpace of the firſt <hi>300.</hi> yeeres after Chriſt.</p>
               <p>From that time forward, Religion began to decline by litle, and litle, from that perfection that it had continued in vnder perſecution, and to grow towards that great decay that it came vnto in the dayes of <hi>Bonifacius</hi> the third. <hi>Martin Luther</hi> therefore, and M. <hi>Iewell,</hi> with the reſt of the authors of the <hi>Apologie</hi> of the Church of England, had iuſt cauſe to ſay that it continued in the Romiſh church for the ſpace of the firſt foure, fiue, yea, ſixe hundreth yéeres after Chriſts aſcention: for the Romiſh church was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togither fallen away from the Catholique Religion, before ſhee had taken vpon hir the title of Antichriſt, which was in the dayes of <hi>Phocas</hi> the Emperor, at whoſe hands <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifacius</hi> obtained the prophane title of vniuerſall biſhop, whereof <hi>Gregorie</hi> the firſt, ſurnamed the great, writeth thus.<note place="margin">Grego.

As for your ſhauing, your clipping, &amp; annoynting that you doo vſe in the ordring &amp; conſecrating of your biſhops, prieſts, &amp; deacons: we eſtéeme as lightly of it as you either doo or can eſtéeme of our maner of ordering and conſecrating of mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of all ſortes.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:11401:46"/>
               <p>Wée know that no ceremonies that are or can be vſed in this behalfe (either by you or by vs) doo or can giue any abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to the perſons towards whom thoſe ceremonies are v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> admitting of them: but we doo vſe them as meanes to put thoſe perſons in remembrance of thoſe duties y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> doo belonge to them in the office &amp; calling, whereunto they are called &amp; admitted. We doo not thinke, that you doo or can by your ceremonies <hi>imprimere charactere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> indelebilem,</hi> that is, imprint into ſuch as you doo order, a marke that can not be blotted out: ſo that your prieſtes being once made prieſtes muſt continue ſo for euer. Neither doo we thinke it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to degrad your prieſts when they returne vnto vs, from your Antichriſtian religion, as you vſe to doo before you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer them to the ſeculer power, when you haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned them for hereſie. For we know that the marke of the beaſt (which they receiued at your hands) is blotted out, by their hearty, and vnfained repentance, the ſignes wherof, we ſée in them before we doo admit them to ſerue in any calling amongſt vs, either Eccleſiaſticall or Ciuill.</p>
               <p>You might much better haue charged vs with conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vnto, and allowing of the lawfulnes of your prieſts &amp; biſhops, bicauſe we be not rebaptiſed: but then (perhaps) you think we would charge you with the like conſent, and approouing of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lawfulnes of our miniſtery, for that you doo not rebaptiſe ſuch as haue bin baptiſed by vs.</p>
               <p>But to be ſhort, I conclude thus. Though we doo receiue ſuch as doo come from you, as S. <hi>Paule</hi> was receiued com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from the Phariſeis, &amp; doo admit them to ſuch offices amongſt vs as wee finde them méete for, as S. <hi>Paule</hi> was admitted to the office of preaching &amp; miniſtration of ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: yet we doo not thereby conſent vnto, or allow of, the lawfulnes of your Antichriſtian miniſters, more then the church y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> receiued S. <hi>Paule</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming from the Phariſeis, did thereby conſent vnto, or allow of the ſect of the Phariſeis.</p>
               <p>If this be a cauſe &amp; reaſon ſufficient (as I think it is) why the Proteſtants ſhould neither take your Antichriſtian mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to be méete miniſters of Chriſtes religion, ſo longe

               <p>If this Offerer had liued in the dayes of the prophets or of the Apoſtles, hée would haue kept a iolly ſtur with them: for none of them were builders of Temples, Synagogues or Churches, neither were they Founders of vniuerſities, ſchooles, or colledges.

               <p>Fifteene. Againe, I do demande of the learned proteſtant <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> whether the <hi>Lutherans, Zuinglians, Illirians, Caluinists, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsioniſts, Svvinkfildians, Anabaptists,</hi> and ſuch like, be all of one church and congregation or no? And if he be able to prooue theſe ſects, being of ſuch diuerſity in faith and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to make one church, and that euery one of them may giue ſaluation to their fellowes, being ſo diſagreeable one with another in high pointes of faith and religion, or that I ought to belieue all thoſe, rather then the one true Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike church of Chriſt: or yet any of theſe, more one then another, all of them making ſuch a bolde challenge of the truth of Gods word and goſpell. When the learned Proteſtant ſhalbe able by good reaſon, or drift of argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to ſatiſfie theſe my requeſts: then I ſhall yeelde and recant, and not before.</p>

               <p>If I did not knowe that this Offerer is paſt all ſhame: I could not meruell enough to ſée that he would demaunde of the learned Proteſtant, a proofe by good reaſon and drift of argument: that <hi>Luther, Zuinglius, Illiricus, Caluin,</hi> the <hi>Confeſſioniſts, Swinkfild,</hi> and the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> ſhould bée
<pb facs="tcp:11401:49"/> members all of one church. For the darkneſſe is no more contrary to the light, neither falſhoode to the truth, nor the deuill to God: then the doctrine of <hi>Swenkfield</hi> and of the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> is to the doctrine of <hi>Luther, Caluin,</hi> and <hi>Zuinglius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this is the drift of this Offerer.

               <p>Vndoubtedly, hée is heerein very much diſceiued. For although wée doo for good cauſe, like very well of the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſome of theſe men that bee heere named: yet wée haue not ſworne to belieue all that they haue written, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet anie one woorde, that they haue written, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then they haue by the ſcriptures made proofe of that which they haue affirmed in writing.

Wée thanke the Lord our God, wée are not ignoraunt what wée doo, and what Chriſtians ought to belieue: and wée are ready and able to render an account of the hope that is in vs. And our God hath made vs able to iudge of the ſpirites, and to diſcerne the ſpirite of truth, from the ſpirite of errour. And by that gifte of our God, wée are made able to ſée that your ſpirite, is the ſpirite of Antichriſt, and your religion Antichriſtian. And that the religion that wée doo profeſſe, is Catholique, and the ſame that was profeſſed and practized, euen in Rome, for the ſpace of 300. yeeres and more, next after the aſcention of our Sauiour Chriſt.</p>

But the Popes religious perſons, doo for the moſt parte, blot out of memorie the names that were giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them when they were baptiſed, as Frier <hi>Iohn Frauncis Minime</hi> of <hi>Nigion</hi> in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> was called <hi>Debnam</hi> by hys Progenie, and kindred whereof he came, and at his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, the name <hi>Samuell</hi> was giuen vnto him.</p>
               <p>I thinke it will be hard for this Offerer to prooue that this is not a flat renouncing of Chriſt and Chriſtendome. For in this new name, not onely the progenie of his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall parentes is renounced, but that religion alſo, that was profeſſed when he was baptiſed, and in that new profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that he hath made, thereis no promiſe made of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Chriſt, or vowe to obſerue Chriſtian religion, but to obay the Father Prior and all the ſuperiours in that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:11401:50"/> and to obſerue that rule of S. <hi>Frauncis</hi> order. If this be not a flatte forſaking of Chriſt: then vndoubtedly, no man can forſake him.</p>
               <p>And what may bée thought of you Antichriſtian Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques? Doo not you forſake Chriſt, where you chuſe a man to bée his Vicar generall, captiueing and ſubmitting your ſeuerall meaninges, to the iudgement of your Prelates and ſpiritual gouerners, and of one chéefe heade and paſtor amongeſt thoſe Prelates, and that in all Eccleſiaſticall thinges and cauſes?</p>
               <p>Well, I would wiſh you to remember your ſelfe better, and to conſider from how good, loouing and faithfull a ſhéep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard you are gone aſtray: and by howe many waies hee hath, and dooth ſtill ſéeke to bringe you home againe to hys ſhéepfolde, the right and true Catholique Church, conſider that you haue willingly wittingly and wilfully made your ſelfe captiue, to the greateſt enimy that your ſhéephearde Chriſt hath or can haue. Make haſt to returne: your ſhéepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard will with ioy receiue you.

If the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant doo anſwer, yea, conſequently it followeth, that they
<pb facs="tcp:11401:51"/> were ſaued without the Church of Chriſt, liuing in all ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunce, ſuperſtition and idolatry, as they ſay. If he aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer no, and that there was no ſaluation out of theyr hyd and vnknowen Church, then all men of al degrees, young and olde, for the whole ſpace of the foreſayd thouſande yeeres, (by the Proteſtantes iudgement,) periſhed without all hope of Gods mercy, and were damned. When therfore the learned Proteſtant ſhalbe able to prooue by good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and argument, eyther that there is a way to ſaluation without the Church of Chriſt, or that all people profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Chriſt, periſhed for ſo many hundreth yeeres togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then wyll I recant, and not before.</p>
               <p>Crowley.</p>
               <p>It ſéemeth that this Offerer perſwadeth himſelfe, that by making this Offer, he ſhall put the learned Proteſtant to ſilence for euer. For if he ſhall open his mouth, and ſay yea, to that demaund which he maketh: then muſt it néedes followe by good conſequence, that there is a way to ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without the Church of Chriſt (whereof no Chriſtians eares can abide the hearing,) And if he ſay no: then it muſt néedes followe (by the lyke conſequence) that all men of all degrees, young and olde, that were borne into the world and profeſſed Chriſt for the ſpace of a thouſand yéeres toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, dyd all periſhe, without all hope of Gods mercie, and were all damned. Thus in the opinion of this proude Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer, the poore Proteſtant, is enforced to giue ouer in the plaine féelde, and to yéeld and recant, and ſo to become a Popiſh Catholique. But I hope wée ſhall ſée it fall out far otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>Fyrſt, the ground whereon this Offerer buildeth hys argument or reaſon is not ſure. For he imagineth that the learned Proteſtants doo hold and affirme, or graunt, that theyr Church, béeing ſuppreſſed by Papiſtrie, ſuperſtition and Idolatrie, dyd lye ſo hidde and vnknowen for the ſpace of a thouſand yéeres: that no man could tell where to finde
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:11401:51"/> it. But that imagination is vaine and fooliſh. For although the Catholique Church (which is the Proteſtants Church) were, during the tyme of blindnes, ſore opreſſed by Popiſh tirannie, and ouercountenaunced by Popiſhe ſuperſtition and Idolatrie: yet was it (euen then) as a cittie ſtanding on an hil, &amp; as a candle on a candleſticke, yea it was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> light of the world, &amp; the ſalt of the earth, <hi>Math,</hi> 5.<note place="margin">Math. 5.</note> For when was the Church more obſcure, or when could it be leſſe regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, then it was at that time wherein our Sauiour ſpake thoſe wordes? As then therefore, euen ſo afterwarde in the tyme of the tenne firſt bloody perſecutions: the Church of Chriſtians was the cittie on the Hill, &amp;c. And ſo was it (and is ſtyll) during thoſe 1000. yéeres that the Offerer ſpeaketh of. For thoſe thouſand yéeres are not yet fully expired: and although God haue giuen Halſion dayes to Chriſtians in ſome regions, as in <hi>Helueſia,</hi> and in the vpper <hi>Germanie,</hi> and now for a fewe yéeres, in <hi>England</hi> and in <hi>Scotland:</hi> yet in <hi>Fraunce, Spayne, Portingale,</hi> and in the lowe countries, and in <hi>Italy,</hi> the ſeauen headed beaſt dooth ſtill holde battell againſt the two witneſſes, that were ſlayne and are reui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 11.<note place="margin">Apoc, 11,</note>
               </p>
               <p>But becauſe our Catholique Church hath not at any time floriſhed in the world, in ſuch pompous maner as the Antichriſtian Catholique Church dooth and euer hath doone ſince it firſt began: therefore this Offerer imagineth, that it lyeth hydde and vnknowen, as in déede it dooth to ſuch as he is: which will not ſée nor knowe, that which moſt eaſilie may be knowen of all men.</p>
               <p>He imagineth alſo, that none of them that haue béene or bée baptiſed amongſt them, haue béene, bée, or can bée, of our Catholique Church, becauſe ſuch doo when they doo firſt come to yéeres of diſcretion, profeſſe Chriſt openly after theyr Antichriſtian manner. But herein he is very much diſceiued: for very many of vs were borne and baptiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt them, of which number, I my ſelfe am one. And when I was growne vp to diſcretion. I profeſſed Chriſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Antichriſtian manner. But God, that had fore ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted
<pb facs="tcp:11401:52"/> me, and the reſt of his choſen children, to be veſſels vnto honour: would not leaue vs in that filthy puddle of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh ſuperſtition, but did by his good meanes drawe vs out, and hath waſhed vs in the fountaine of water by the word of lyfe. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.<note place="margin">Ephe, 6,</note> And we doo not doubt but there bée yet many amongeſt you, that in Gods good time ſhalbe drawne out of that filthy puddle, and waſhed as we bée.</p>
               <p>No maruaile though ſuch as this Offerer is can not ſée this: For euen <hi>Elias</hi> the Prophet could not ſée the like in Iſraell in his dayes.

               <p>But that Catholique Church whereof we Proteſtants be members: hath not any at time intermitted y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vſe of theſe two Sacraments that Chriſt hath ordayned, no not in the tyme of moſt bloody perſecution, as in moſt auncient Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries it dooth appeare. And after the ende of thoſe bloody per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions (which dyd continue almoſt to the ende of the firſt 300. yéeres after Chriſtes aſcention (the ſame Church dyd continue the vſe of the ſame Sacramentes publiquely and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:11401:55"/> openly, which before that time bloodie Tirrannie would not ſuffer them to doo.</p>
               <p>But when the tyme of Apoſtacie was come, and the man of ſinne (of whom S. <hi>Paule</hi> wrote, 2, <hi>Theſſa,</hi> 2.<note place="margin">2, Theſſa, 2</note>) had gotten the vpper hand: then this Church was inforced to leaue that open vſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of Sacraments that it had continued for the ſpace (almoſt) of 300. yéeres, and to vſe them, as before ſhee had doone, in the time of the firſt bloody perſecutions. For the Romane Church béeing fallen away from the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church, became as bloodily minded, as euer the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Empire had béene.</p>
               <p>Thus the Catholique Church (whereof wee bée mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers) hath continued and dooth ſtil continue the vſe of thoſe Sacraments that Chriſt hath inſtituted. As for confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, order, and that which you call penaunce, matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and extreame vnction: wée doo not acknowledge to bée Sacraments, becauſe they agrée not with the definition or diſcription of a Sacrament, which is, a viſible ſigne of an inuiſible ſpirituall grace, inſtituted by Chriſt him ſelfe: we knowe and doo confeſſe that confirmation is a good order, and may bée vſed to the edification of the Church, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it is appointed by publique Authority, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> when young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linges ſhalbe inſtructed ſo that they ſhalbe able in ſome meaſure to make profeſſion of the Chriſtian fayth: they ſhal bée brought to the Biſhop, that by prayer to God for them, and laying on of his handes vpon them, they may bée the better confirmed in that faith which they haue learned and profeſſed.</p>
               <p>The ordering, of miniſters, we allowe of alſo, as of a good &amp; profitable order in the Church: for we know that no man may take vpon himſelfe, that honour, but ſuch as ſhalbe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thereunto as <hi>Aron</hi> was. And therefore, as great care as may be is taken in the choſing of ſuch as ſhalbe admitted to the miniſtry, and as great circumſpection in the admitting.<note place="margin">Heb. 5.</note> If any fault be in this behalfe: it is not in the lawe that preſcribeth a good and perfect order to be obſerued herein, but in the lacke of care that may be in ſuch as haue the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
<pb facs="tcp:11401:56"/> of the law. As touching that which you cal penance, wée doo neither accept of it as of a Sacrament, (becauſe we knowe that it is none) neyther doo we take it for a good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, becauſe we doo knowe that it is derogatorie to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of Chriſt. The firſt part of your penaunce, whych you call contrition, or inward ſorrow of hart, wee doo like well of, for as the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith. <hi>Pſalme</hi> 51.<note place="margin">Pſal, 51,</note> An humble and broken hart (O God) thou wilte not deſpiſe. Yea hee ſayth that a troubled ſpirit is a ſacrifice to God. The ſecond parte of your penaunce, is confeſſion. That part wee doo lyke of alſo: but not in ſuch order as it is vſed amongeſt you. That is that the penitent perſon ſhall make rehearſall of all hys ſinnes in the hearing of a Préeſt that knoweth not whether he ſpeake truely or not. As S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath written in his tenth booke of confeſſions,<note place="margin">Auguſti. Conf. li. 10, Capi, 3.</note> and in the thirde Chapter thereof. What haue I to do with men (ſayth S. <hi>Auſtine</hi>) that they ſhould here my confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp;c. We doo exhorte all men, to confeſſe all theyr ſinnes to God, againſt whome they are committed, and in whoſe power onelie it is to forgiue them. If our ſinnes be ſecret, ſo that none but God onely dooth knowe them: then doo we thinke it good to followe the counſell of <hi>Sirach,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccleſ, 19,</note> chap, 19, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare not thy ſinnes, neyther to fréende nor to foe, &amp;c. But if we haue ſinned one of vs againſt an other: then we thinke it méete to followe the councell of S. <hi>Iames,</hi> in his Epiſtle, chap, 5.<note place="margin">Iacob, 5,</note> Confeſſe your ſinnes one to an other, &amp;c. But if the horrour of our ſinnes be ſo great, that we can not, by anie of theſe meanes be aſſured of forgiuenes of them: then wée doo reſorte, not to an ignoraunt Préeſt, but to ſuch a one as we are aſſured can (or at the leaſt way, we are perſwaded y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he can) aſſure vs by the ſcriptures, that repenting our ſins vnfaynedly and purpoſing to turne away from them, from thence foreward continually: the merciful God (our father) dooth ſo pardon and forgiue them, that hee will neuer laye them to our charge any more.</p>
               <p>But y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> third part of your penaunce, which you call ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction: wee doo vtterly deteſt and abhorre. For that wee doo
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:11401:56"/> knowe by the ſcriptures, that onely Chriſt is able to make ſatiſfaction to God for ſinne. Becauſe no creature could bee worthy or méete to make ſatiſfaction to God for ſinne: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God the creator of creatures, would in the ſecond per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in Trinity, become man, that in mans nature he might dye, and be made a ſacrifice for the ſinnes of the world, yea that he might make him ſelfe a ſacrifice, and by that one ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice take away the ſinnes of the world. If you luſt to ſée what Scriptures wee haue, for proofe of this that I haue here written: looke the 53, of Eſaies prophecies, and the, 63,<note place="margin">Ephe, 53. &amp;, 63 Math. 1. Iohn, 1, 1.

               <p>Your extreame vnction, we doo not onely denie to bée a Sacrament becauſe we finde in Hiſtories, that Pope <hi>Foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix</hi> the fourth of that name, that occupied the place of the Papacie about, 525, yéeres after the incarnation of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt, was the firſt that tooke order for the anoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the bodyes of ſuch as lay in dying, with oyle: But al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſo becauſe the manner of the vſing of it, is too too full of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition.

And becauſe your ſorte doo make accounte of fiue other Sacramentes, in déede: I haue written bréefely of them alſo.</p>
               <p>The Catholique Church (whereof we Proteſtantes are members) hath from tyme to tyme had the hearing of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in controueſie, and ſo hath it ſtill, ſo farre foorth as the ſame may appertaine vnto her to iudge of them. That is, where and when the parties that be at controuerſie do ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelues to her iudgement. For what hath ſhe to doo with them that be without? As S. <hi>Paule</hi> wrote to the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,
<pb facs="tcp:11401:58"/> 1. Cor. 5.<note place="margin">1, Cor. 5.</note> Such as are not of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſocietie of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt, are not to be iudged by the church of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And as touching the orderly ſucceſſion of Biſhops: wee are able to ſhewe by the Hiſtories of the Church, that our Church hath had aboue, 60. Biſhops in Rome, ſucceſſiuely one after another, whereof the greateſt number were good men, and carefull to gouerne the flocke committed to their charge, as S. <hi>Paule</hi> wiſhed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Elders or Biſhops of <hi>Eph.</hi> to doo <hi>Act.</hi> 20. But here the Offerer, muſt note, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> none of theſe was called or would be called vniuerſal Biſhops, or vniuer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſal heads,<note place="margin">Acts, 20.</note> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vniuerſal church of Chriſt. They knew y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the charge that was committed vnto them in Roome and in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Churches of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prouince, was great enough for them, they ſought for no more charge. But when any other Biſhops dyd ſéeke to them for councell: they were readye to helpe them to the vttermoſt of theyr power, but none of them did claime any power or authority ouer the reſt. The reſt of the Biſhoppes in Roome, that ſuccéeded <hi>Gregorie</hi> the firſt: namely <hi>Boniface</hi> the third, and ſuch as ſuccéeded him, were Antichriſtian Biſhops, and therefore wee refuſe them as none of ours. Neither is it ſo neceſſarie a matter to haue ſo orderly a ſucceſſion of Biſhoppes in any one Cittie in the chriſtian worlde, as in the firſt 600. hundreth yéeres after Chriſt, there was in Roome.</p>
               <p>But becauſe the cittie Roome was then (and had béene of long tyme before) the chéefe cittie of the whole world: the peoples that inhabited in other Citties and partes of the world, owing ſeruice to the ſtate of Roome, had occaſion to repaire thether, and therefore euen the chriſtians that had theyr dwelling elſe where, had the Biſhoppes, and other Church miniſters that were in Roome, in greater eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then they had thoſe men that were of the lyke calling, euen in the citties wherein they themſelues had theyr a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boade and dwelling.</p>
               <p>And hereof it might come that greter account was made of the ſucceſſion of thoſe Biſhops that were Biſhoppes of Roome, then of thoſe that were in <hi>Millen, Conſtantinople,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:11401:58"/> Ieruſalem, Hippo,</hi> or in any other part of the whole world, But if this orderly ſucceſſion of biſhops that ſo great accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is made of were well weighed, it would not bee founde ſo certaine as thys Offerer and his fellowes, would faine haue it ſéeme to bée.</p>
               <p>S, <hi>Auſtine</hi> (whoſe anthoritie is not to bee contemned) hauing occaſion to make mention of this ſucceſſion: placeth <hi>Linus</hi> next vnto <hi>Peter,</hi> and maketh no mention at all of <hi>Cletus,</hi> and ſo he maketh in this ſucceſſion leſſe by one, then the common account is. Some others doo ſuppoſe, that <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> and <hi>Cletus,</hi> were but <hi>Peters <hi>coadiutors,</hi>
                  </hi> and not Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of Roome at all: For <hi>Peter</hi> him ſelfe ſayd vnto <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> I giue vnto thée, the ſame power of binding and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that Chriſt left vnto me: and ſo he made <hi>Clement</hi> hys immediate ſucceſſour. Yea there be ſome that doo thinke, (and I doo thinke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they haue ſome good cauſe ſo to thinke) that <hi>Peter</hi> him ſelfe, was neuer Biſhop of Roome.</p>
               <p>But let the ſucceſſion of Biſhops in the firſt <hi>600.</hi> yéeres, be euen ſuch as this Offerer and his fellowes doo ſuppoſe it to be: yet y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſucceſſion that hath bene ſince the end of thoſe firſt. 600, yeres: is not ſo currant as they do auouch it to be.</p>
               <p>For it appeareth in Hiſtories, that the ſeate of Roome hath béene voyde for the ſpace of whole yéere togeather, yea for the ſpace of two yéeres and more: and that there haue béene two Popes, yea thrée Popes at one time, where of one hath excommunicated the other, and no man was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſay which of them ſhold by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> right ſucceſſour of <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I would gladly vnderſtand by this Offerer and his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, what manner of ſucceſſion that was, when aboute the yéere of our Lord, <hi>855. Ioane Engliſh,</hi> borne at <hi>Menſſe,</hi> béeing a woman in ſexe and nature, was made Pope, and continued ſo for the ſpace of two yéeres. I thinke they will not ſay that this was an orderly ſucceſſion.</p>
               <p>To bée bréefe, the ſucceſſion of the Romane Biſhoppes, ſince the time of <hi>Bonifacius, 3.</hi> hath béene ſuch as the ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of high Préeſts was in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kingdome of Iſraell, from the time of the falling away of the tenne kindreds from the

               <p>And as the right profeſſours of the lawe of God in Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell and Iuda (which vndoubtedly were many) had in al this tyme no ſucceſſion of highe Préeſtes: ſo ſuch as in theſe lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>1000</hi> yéeres haue béene the right Catholiques, haue had no ſucceſſion of Biſhops, but haue receiued theyr ſpirituall foode, at the hands of ſuch paſtors as God hath from time to time ſtirred vp, as he ſtirred vp Prophets in Iuda &amp; Iſrael in thoſe times wherof I haue ſpoken before: &amp; as often as it hath pleaſed God to giue his Church libertie to make pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique profeſſion of fayth and religion (as now for the ſpace of <hi>29.</hi> yéeres togeather, he hath doone in this realme of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>) ſuch as be members of the true Catholique Church, doo and haue doone (by the permiſſion and commaundement, of our Prince, whom God hath appointed to gouerne vs) as it becommeth Catholike Chriſtians to doo, in open prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, preaching, and adminiſtration of Sacramentes.</p>
               <p>And to the ende that all thinges may bée doon orderly and as it beſeemeth, we haue biſhops &amp; al other neceſſary mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, orderly elected &amp; admitted, to miniſter vnto vs y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word and to exerciſe publique prayer &amp; neceſſarie diſcipline, ſuche as the higher powers vnder whome we liue, doo thinke méete to be exerciſed.</p>
               <p>As for the vniformity of your ſolemne Ceremonies: that had not had ſo long continuance for the ſpace of fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>téene hundreth yéeres, nor yet for the ſpace of fifty yéeres. For by the confeſſion of your holy father Pope <hi>Pius quintus</hi> the difference of ceremonies vſed euen in your holy Maſſe, was ſuch before the tyme of your laſt generall Councell, which began at <hi>Trident.

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:11401:59"/> what great matter is there in it, to prooue thereby that your Church is the true Church of Chriſt: ſith it is an eaſie matter for any ſorte of men to agrée in outward and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne Ceremonies, although the ſame bee neuer ſo ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious, vaine and fooliſh.</p>
               <p>But here is a matter of greater waight; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is the vnity of fayth that your Church hath had theſe <hi>1500,</hi> yéeres laſt paſt continually.

               <p>But here riſeth a doubte, whether this Church be the general councell, the colledge of Cardinalles, or the Popes holines alone.

               <p>I leaue this to your diſcretion, or to the diſcretion of ſome one of your ſorte that ſhall take in hand to replye to this aunſwer that I make to theſe your offers.</p>
               <p>You ſaye, that your Church hath in her ſelfe all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie functions of the ſpirite: as workinge of miracles, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſinnes, and the true ſence and interpretation of Gods worde.

               <p>Wée doo know and confeſſe, that our ſauiour Chriſt hath giuen powre to his church, both to remit and to retaine ſinnes, and that powre dooth our Catholike church exerciſe, by certifying the penitent ſinners (by the ſcriptures) that their ſinnes vnfainedly repented, be vndoubtedly pardoned through Chriſt, in whom they muſt belieue aſſuredly, that ſhalbe capable of this remiſſion of ſinnes.

The ſcriptures are the keyes that Chriſt gaue vnto <hi>Peter,</hi> and in him to his whole church: as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> hath written in his fiftith treatiſe vpon <hi>Ioh. <hi>Si hoc ergo in Eccleſia fit,</hi>

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:11401:61"/> now belonge to any one perſon alone in the Church, but to the whole Church togither.</p>
               <p>You ſay further that your church hath the true ſenſe &amp; interpretation of the woorde of God, ſo that no ſenſe or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of Gods woorde, may bee taken for true, but that which is ſet down by your church, although that which is ſet downe by your church ſhalbe prooued to bee directly contrarie to the text of Gods woord it ſelfe.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:11401:62"/> counſell, decréed that the Images of Chriſt, of the Virgin (the mother of God) and of other ſaintes, muſt be had and retayned, eſpecially in churches, and that their due honour and reuerence muſt bée giuen vnto them.</p>
               <p>Much more might bee noted out of your generall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelles, where by it might bee made moſt manifeſt &amp; plaine, that there was neuer any ſorte of Heretikes, that ſwarued further from the true ſenſe and interpretation of the word of God, euen in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chiefeſt points of religion, then that Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue of Satan, your Antichriſtian Catholike church, hath doone for the ſpace of theſe <hi>1000.</hi> yéeres now laſt paſt (almoſt) and dooth ſtill.</p>
               <p>But your church is beautified with diuerſity of ſtates commended by Chriſt, as with Martyrs, with Confeſſors, holy Virgins and ſuch other. If a man ſhould require you to ſhew your Martyrologie, and to ſhew the cauſes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe Martyrs of yours ſuffered: it would bee hard for you to make proofe, that any one of thoſe that you doo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for Martyrs, did ſuffer for any other then for Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt. If you ſhall begin with <hi>Thomas Becket,</hi> the beſt that you can ſay for him, is that hée died for the liberties of the Church. And what were thoſe liberties? That all cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie men ſhould be exempted from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> powre of their princes. So that if a clergie man, ſhould co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit any maner of felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, murther, or Treaſon, or any other capitall crime: none of the princes officers might deale with him, to execute the penalty of the lawe vpon him, as vpon a felon, murderer, or Traytor: but he muſt be puniſhed by this Ordinarie, &amp;c. And what was this other, then to dye for Antichriſt, who contrary to Chriſts doctrine, vſurpeth authoritie ouer prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and wil not ſuffer any of his to be in ſubiection to prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and to princes lawes?</p>
               <p>To bee briefe, Biſhop <hi>Fyſhar,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Moore,</hi> the Monkes of the charter houſe, with all the reſt of the Popes friends that ſuffered in the daies of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight: and <hi>Edmond Campion</hi> with his companie, and the reſt that haue bene executed in the time of the raigne of our

This cauſe can not bee Chriſts cauſe: for Chriſt did in his humaine nature, ſubmit him ſelfe to the Emperor, in that hee him ſelfe did pay tribute to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, in token of ſubiection. <hi>Mat. 17.</hi>

               <p>This Offer may bee diuided into three partes. In the firſt the Offerer requireth a proofe of that which is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy prooued in the anſwere to the ſeuententh Offer. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I refer y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> reader to that which is written there, where hée ſhall finde that which may ſatiſfie him in that which the Popiſh Offerer requireth the learne Proteſtant to prooue firſt. In the ſecond part, he requireth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Proteſtant to prooue that the church whereof be is, hath had at ſome one time or other, ſuch powre and authority ouer the whole Chriſtian world, as the Romiſh Catholike Antichriſtian church, hath vſurped and exerciſed and doth ſtill claime &amp; exerciſe, where it may bée ſuffred. To this I doo ſay, on the behalfe of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:11401:70"/> Proteſtant: that Chriſt him ſelfe did neuer exerciſe ſuch authoritie ouer kingdomes and Nations, as the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Popiſh church hath exerciſed, and dooth ſtill exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, ſo farfoorth as it is able, and may be ſuffered. Neyther did our Sauiour Chriſt, giue any ſuch authoritie to his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, as to haue all Chriſtian Nations vnder obedience, or to call them togither to generall Counſells, or to execute diſcipline vpon them, and to correct their falts: for that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is giuen vnto Princes, and Chriſt did not come to take that powre from them, but hee hath confirmed it in them. The Apoſtles therefore, and the Apoſtolike men that were the immediate Succeſſors of the Apoſtles, euen as many as God made excellent in his Church, in the time that was before Antichriſt began to ſhewe him ſelfe in the eſtate of the papacie: were contented to leaue that powre to princes and did both by doctrine, and by example of life, teach all Chriſtians to ſhew their due obedience to Princes. But when your Biſhops of Rome were become Antichriſtian: then they muſt needes aduaunce them ſelues aboue all that is called God (that is aboue all Princes) and they muſt ſit in the temple of God, and boaſt them ſelues as though they had bin Gods, that ſo they might bee knowne to bee that man of ſinne that Saint <hi>Paule</hi> ment of, in that hee wrote, 2.

For anſwere to this: the learned Proteſtant: referreth the Reader to that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere that hee hath made to the ſeuentéenth and to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>téenth Offer, with this addition, that if this Offerer can prooue, that euer any of theſe excellent properties or pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier denominations and callings, might poſſibly agrée to that knowne Antichriſtian church that hee is of: then will this learned Proteſtant, relent, yeelde, and recant, and bee an Antichriſtian Catholique, and not before.</p>

                  <p>Touching this firſt ſigne and token, which this Offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer would appropriate vnto vs, as vnto Antichriſtians, falſe Prophets, Heretiques, and ſchiſmatikes: I might very well referre the indifferent Reader to that which I haue written in anſwere to the tenth Offer. Where I haue made it manifeſt, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> the ſame faith and religion that wée doo profeſſe and practize now, was profeſſed &amp; practized in the time of the Apoſtles, and many yéeres after the aſcention of our ſauiour Chriſt, although not ſo purely towards the ende of thoſe ſixe hundreth yéeres, as at the beginning of them, and for the ſpace of <hi>300.</hi> yéeres, and more.</p>
                  <p>But to let this Offerer and his fellowes ſee wherein they be diſceiued: I will adde ſome thing to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which I haue written there: making it manifeſt, that this Offerer and his fellowes did depart from vs and from our Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wée did depart from them and their church. They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from vs and our Church, without cauſe: but we did departe from their Church for iuſt cauſe. When S. <hi>Iohn</hi> wrote theſe woords, <hi>Ex nobis prodierunt, &amp;c.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 2.</note> They went out from vs, but they were not of vs, &amp;c: the church of Rome was Catholique, Chriſtian, Holy, and Apoſtolike. They therefore that did then depart from them, were An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian, and Schiſmaticall: and were not of them whilſe
<pb facs="tcp:11401:72"/> they were amongſt them, and therefore they did not tarie with them. And you and men of your ſorte, are they, that in the daies of <hi>Phocas</hi> the Emperor, did openly departe from our Catholique church, &amp; became a ſchiſmaticall Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian church (or rather Synagogue of Satan) perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the true Catholique church of Chriſt continually from that day to this.</p>
                  <p>Wée therefore being amongſt you till it pleaſed God to open the eyes of our vnderſtanding, ſo that wée might ſee the abhominations of your Antichriſtian religion: were not of you, and therefore wee did departe from you, not leauing our Faith and Religion wherein wée were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, for wée were baptized in the name of Chriſt, and not of Antichriſt. For though God haue ſuffered you to diuiſe many toyes, which you doo vſe in the miniſtration of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme: yet hee would neuer ſuffer you to alter the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Sacrament, for you doo ſtill baptiſe in the name of the Father, of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghoſt. And therefore, wee ſeeke not to bee rebaptized, knowing that the baptiſme which wee receiued at your hands, is as effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall as that which wée our ſelues doo miniſter to our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants. Wee are not therefore departed from the true Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique church of Chriſt: but from your Antichriſtian church, and wee are returned againe to that true Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique church from which your ſorte departed, when <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niface</hi> the third, tooke vpon him that Antichriſtian name of vniuerſall biſhop.

But our louing Father hath in his good time, &amp; by his good meanes, brought vs out from amongſt you, and reſtored vs againe to our good mother (his deerely beloued ſpouſe) the true Catholique, Holy, and Apoſtolike church: out of whoſe plentifull Dugs wee doo daily ſucke, the ſwéete, pleaſant, &amp; healthſome mylke that feedeth vs vnto euerlaſting lyfe.</p>
                  <p>This mother that wee are returned to, is that romiſh Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique

                  <p>By the mercifull goodnes of our Father, working in vs by his holy ſpirite, wée doo now belieue, as the children of our mother then in Rome did belieue. They belieued then, that there is but one God y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hath made all creatures, and him they glorified in the vſe of his creatures: and they gaue thanks to him alone for thoſe creatures, and ſtudied to ſerue him onely in ſpirite and with ſpirituall ſeruice, flying from th'example of the Heathen nations, that preſumed to counterfaite his maieſtie by Images. <hi>Ro. 1.</hi>

                  <p>They belieued, that their duetie was to ſubmit them ſelues, to all ſuch as God had ſet ouer them in authoritie, &amp; to obay them, not only for feare of puniſhment, but for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake alſo: knowing that who ſoeuer reſiſteth the powre, reſiſteth the ordinaunce of God, &amp; dooth purchaſe to him ſelfe damnation. And they belieued that their duetie was to giue euerie man his owne, and to vſe louing beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour towards all men: knowing that loue is the fulfilling of the law. And that being baptized, they had apparelled them ſelues with Chriſt, and that they ought to walke and continue their liues in holineſſe and in honeſtie, not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king prouiſion for the fleſh, to ſatiſfie the luſts thereof. <hi>Rom. 13.</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Exod. 4.</note> and by externall and viſible vncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Moſes</hi> him ſelfe was ordinarily called and ſent of God, approoued by myracle, as it appeereth in the fourth Chapter of <hi>Exodus.</hi> And therefore the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paule,</hi> nameth <hi>Aaron,</hi> and not <hi>Moſes,</hi> to ſignifie, that all extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie vocations by myracies, as (<hi>Moſes</hi> was) are now ceaſed; and wee muſt from henceforth bee ordinarily cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by externall vnction, as <hi>Aaron</hi> was.</p>
                  <p>When therefore the learned proteſtant ſhall be able to prooue their iuſt and due vocation ordinarily or extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily to proceede of God, and not onely of men, I ſhall then yeelde and recant, and not before.</p>
                  <p>Crowley.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt Period, or perfect ſentence of this ſure mark (as this Offerer dooth terme it) hee chargeth vs vniuſtly with three crimes. Whereof the firſt is, A departing from the Catholique church. The ſecond is, the ſetting vp of a
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:11401:74"/> new faith and religion. And the third is, the aſſembling of a new church and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregation. I haue in mine anſwere to the firſt ſigne, ſufficiently prooued, that not wée Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, but this Offerer &amp; his fellowes, bee guilty in theſe thrée points: For they are departed from the true Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique church, they haue ſet vp a new faith and religion: and they haue aſſembled and ſet vp, &amp; doo ſtill labour to aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſet vp, a new church and congregation.</p>
                  <p>In the reſt of this ſure marke of his, hée wreſteth far out of tune two ſentences that Saint <hi>Paule</hi> hath written, the one to the Romaines, and the other to the Hebrews. To the Romaines S. <hi>Paule</hi> hath written thus in the <hi>10.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 20.</note> Chap. <hi>Quomodo, &amp;c.</hi> How ſhall men preach, except they bée ſent? And to the Hebrews hee ſaith thus, <hi>Cap. 5.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hebr, 5</note> 
                     <hi>Nec quiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam, &amp;c.</hi> Let no man take vnto him ſelfe honor, except hée be called of God, like as <hi>Aaron</hi> was. By theſe two places, our Offerer will prooue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wee proteſtants haue no lawfull miniſters in our Church, bicauſe our miniſters be not ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily called by outward &amp; viſible vnction, as <hi>Aaron</hi> was, &amp; ſo ſent foorth to preach and miniſter, as their ſmered &amp; ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen Prieſts bée.</p>
                  <p>But I hope, the indifferent reader ſhall plainly ſée, how violently this man dooth racke theſe ſayings of S. <hi>Paule,</hi> to make them ſéeme to ſerue his purpoſe. In the <hi>10. <hi>Cap.</hi>
                     </hi> of his Epiſtle to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Romans: S. <hi>Paule</hi> maketh it plain vnto them, that God doth in mercy embrace all men that belieuing his promiſe, doo call vpon him: and thus he ſaith. <hi>Non enim eſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctio Iudaei &amp; Greci: nam idem Dominus omnium, diues in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mnes qui inuocant illum, &amp;c.</hi> There is no difference of Iew, &amp; Gréeke: for one is Lord of all, &amp; rich towards all, that doo cal vpon him. For euery one whoſoeuer ſhal call vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of the Lord ſhalbe ſaued: how therefore ſhall they call vpon him, in whom they haue not belieued? Or how ſhall they giue credit to him, whom they haue not heard? And how ſhal they heare w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out a preacher?<note place="margin">Eſay, 52.</note> And how ſhal they preach except they be ſent? as it is written. How glorious are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> féet of them that preach peace, and that preach good things.</p>

But ſome man peraduenture, will ſay, and how can they call vpon him in whom they haue not belieued? And then after this obiection, followeth his queſtion, that is to ſay, why haue they not belieued? And after theſe woords: a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nother obiection followeth alſo: for thus it might be ſaid in déed. And how ſhal they belieue, when they haue not heard? But he ſaith that they haue heard. And yet againe, there is another obiection. And howe coulde they heare, without a preacher? The ſolution wherof is againe ſet down ſtraight after. But many haue preached, which haue bin ſent for the ſame purpoſe. And how is it plainely prooued that theſe bee they that were ſent? Then doth he very well bring in the prophet ſaying. How beautifull are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> féete of them that doo declare peace, and that doo declare good things? Doo you not ſée, how he dooth declare the preachers themſelues, by the maner of their preaching? For they went about, vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring by ſpéech, none other thing then thoſe ineffable good things, &amp; that peace, that was made betwixt God &amp; men, &amp;c.

                  <p>By theſe woords of <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> it is manifeſt, that in his iudgment the note whereby preachers are knowne to bee ſent of God: is the maner of their preaching.

                  <p>And this iudgment of <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> is according to that which S. <hi>Iohn</hi> hath written in the fourth Chapter of his firſt Epiſtle. <hi>Chariſsimi, nolite omni ſpiritui credere,</hi>

By this is the ſpirite of God knowne. Euery ſpirite, that confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that Ieſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh, is of God: and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery ſpirite that deuideth Ieſus, is not of God, &amp; the ſame is Antichriſt, of whom yee haue heard that hée commeth, and euen now he is in the world.</p>
                  <p>Theſe woords of the Apoſtle S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> doo make manifeſt and plaine that iudgment of <hi>Chryſoſtome:</hi> which is, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preachers which are ſent of God, are not ſo well diſcerned from them that are not ſent of God, by any outward ſigne or token, as by the maner of their preaching.</p>
                  <p>If they confeſſe Ieſus Chriſt to bée commen in the fleſh (<hi>ſaith</hi> S. <hi>Iohn</hi>) then vndoubtedly they bee of God: but if they deuide Ieſus, then without all doubt, they are not of God, but they are then of Antichriſt. But wee which bée Catholique Proteſtants, doo confeſſe that Ieſus Chriſt is commen in the fleſh, and the Popiſh Catholiques doo deny him to bee commen in the fleſh: Therefore wée bée of God,
<pb facs="tcp:11401:76"/> and bée ſent of him, and the popiſh Catholiques, are not of God, neither are they ſent of him, but they are of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, and are his meſſengers.</p>
                  <p>The Offerer and his fellowes will deny the latter part of the <hi>Minor propoſition</hi> (that is) that they deny Chriſt to bée commen in the fleſh: therefore, the learned Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant muſt prooue it.</p>
                  <p>For proofe that the Popyſh Catholique dooth deny Chriſt to bée commen in the fleſh: the learned Proteſtant ſaith thus. Who ſoeuer dooth deuide Ieſus, dooth deny him to bée commen in the fleſh: but the popiſh Catholique dooth deuide Ieſus: therefore the popiſh Catholique dooth deny Chriſt to bée commen in the fleſh.</p>
                  <p>Héere the popiſh Catholique will deny, that hée deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth Ieſus. To this the learned Proteſtant muſt ſay, that by interpretation <hi>Ieſus</hi> dooth ſignifie a Sauiour. But the popiſh Catholique dooth deuide the Sauiour, hée dooth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deuide <hi>Ieſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if the popiſh Catholique will ſay, that hée deuideth not the Sauiour, then the learned proteſtant muſt ſay, that the popiſh Catholique dooth aſcribe part of his ſaluation to Chriſt, and parte to his owne workes, and to the merits, of holy Saintes. Hée dooth therefore diuide the Sauiour: and ſo conſequently, hée denieth Ieſus to bée come in the fleſh. For Chriſt his comming in the fleſh was to ſaue ſinners. <hi>1. Timoth. 1.</hi>

                  <p>Thus much may the learned proteſtant conclude againſt the popiſh Catholique, out of the words of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> as they he tranſlated out of the Gréeke &amp; allowed of by thoſe popiſh

                  <p>Thus (by the help of <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>) the learned prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, hath made it plaine to the indifferent reader, that S. <hi>Paule,</hi> writing thus to the Romans. (How ſhal they preach except they be ſent?) Had no ſuch meaning as this Offerer dooth beare the world in hand that hée had. That is: that no preachers can be thought to be ſent of God, but ſuch only as are allowed of, by ſome popiſh Prelate.</p>

Nam qui praeeſſe festinat, quidam patrum eliganter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsit dicens: ſciat ſe non eſſe Epiſcopum, qui praeeſſe cupit, non prodeſſe.</hi> In engliſh thus, Know this, that not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> man, whom the commendation, or rather y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> flatterie of a few men dooth chooſe, but he whom both life and maners of the beſt ſort, &amp; the action of Apoſtolike prieſtes dooth commend, is ſent of God: or els that man that is allowed of by the iudgment of all people, ſuch a one as deſireth not to beare rule, &amp; that doth not giue money that he may obtaine the honor of a bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop.

                  <p>In theſe woords of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> it appéereth, that in his iudgment, it is not the ordinarie calling and externall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that wee ſhould looke vnto, when wée bee deſirous to know, what preachers be ſent of God: but it is their good life, &amp; the good liking that good men haue of them: yea, and the good opinion that all men are enforced to haue in them, bicauſe they ſée in them no ſigne of ambition, or deſire of honor, but contrariwiſe, that they are deſirous to be occupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in doing good. By theſe ſignes (ſaith S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>) yee ſhall know that they are ſent of God. So that as <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi> ſaith, that they are knowne by the maner of their preaching: ſo S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> doth ſay, that they are knowne by their life.</p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:11401:77"/>
                  <p>But now, the Offerer (or ſome of his friends) will ſay, that S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> is againſt vs in theſe woords, <hi>Et apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum actio commendat ſacerdotum.</hi> In engliſh thus. And ſuch a one as the action of the Apoſtolike prieſts dooth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend. Theſe Apoſtolike prieſts, muſt néedes be popiſh Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques, (in the iudgment of this Offerer &amp; his fellows:) for with them, onely <hi>Peter</hi> is the Apoſtle: and Rome, the Apoſtolike ſeate, bicauſe (as they imagine) <hi>Peter</hi> was by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop there <hi>25.</hi> yéere, &amp; left his powre, &amp; authority there with his immediate ſucceſſor. But who was that ſucceſſor, they are not yet agréed: for ſome of them ſay it was <hi>Clement,</hi> &amp; ſome ſay it was <hi>Limus.</hi> But this is their concluſion: that whoſoeuer is biſhop of Rome, muſt néedes haue <hi>Peters</hi> au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority by ſucceſſion in that ſeate, although hee bée in life, &amp; doctrine, neuer ſo vnlike, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to <hi>Peter.</hi> And none may be accounted Apoſtolike, but ſuch as be of or vnder the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of that Apoſtolike ſucceſſion: but by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> circumſtance of S. <hi>Auguſtines</hi> woords, it appéereth that hee taketh them for Apoſtolike prieſts, that are moſt like vnto the Apoſtles in life and in doctrine, and in painefull trauell, and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall care to doo good in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church of Chriſt.

And they are euen the ſame men that are ſpoken vnto in thoſe laſt woords that I haue cyted out of S. <hi>Auguſtine: <hi>ſciat ſe non eſſe Epiſcopum, qui praeeſſe cupit, non prodeſſe.</hi>
                     </hi> Let that man, which coueteth to beare rule, and not to doo good, knowe: that hee is no biſhop.</p>
                  <p>But let vs nowe ſee what this Offerer hath cited out of the fift Chapter to the Hebrewes.<note place="margin">Heb. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>Nec quiſquam ſibi ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit honorem, niſi qui vocatur a Deo, quemadmodum &amp; Aaron.</hi> No man taketh honor vnto him ſelfe, except hee bée called of God, as <hi>Aaron</hi> was. Firſt I muſt note, that this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer hath not dealt ſimply, in that he hath tranſlated theſe
<pb facs="tcp:11401:78"/> wroodes thus: let no man take vnto him ſelfe, &amp;c. For by this tranſlation, it ſéemeth to bée a commaundement giuen, or a rule ſet downe by the Apoſtle: which rule muſt néedes bee kept in the admitting of all ſuch as ſhalbe miniſters in the church of Chriſt. So that who ſoeuer is not admitted according to that rule, may not bée taken for a Catholique miniſter, nor his miniſtration allowed of.</p>
                  <p>But let vs ſée in what meaning the Apoſtle did write the woords. The circumſtance of the text dooth make it plaine, that the Apoſtles purpoſe was to prooue, that <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons</hi> prieſthoode was at an ende, and that the high prieſtes that had bin made after the Order of <hi>Aaron,</hi> were farre in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour vnto Chriſt, that is our high Prieſt, not after the Order of <hi>Aaron,</hi> but of <hi>Melchizedech.</hi> And yet our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt was no vſurper: for hée was called of God as <hi>Aaron</hi> was. And herein hée was like vnto <hi>Aaron.</hi> But in that <hi>Aaron,</hi> and ſuch as were made high Prieſts after his Order, did offer Sacrifice for their owne ſinnes, Chriſt was nothing like them, for hee neded not to offer for any ſinnes of his owne, ſith there was no ſinne in him.</p>
                  <p>But how maketh this for our Offerers purpoſe? The Apoſtles meaning was to prooue that <hi>Aarons</hi> Prieſthoode was now come to an ende, and muſt now giue place to the Prieſthoode of Chriſt, which ſhoulde neuer haue an ende.

                  <p>Wée doo not holde or teach, that euery man may thruſt himſelfe into the miniſtery without orderly calling: or that any man may take vnto himſelfe the honor of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> calling, not being called of God as <hi>Aaron</hi> was: but wée doo both holde &amp;

And the fruites there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of (which you call worthy) as faſting, watchinge, praying, and all ſtraightnes of lyfe, are ſuperſticious and Hipocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call: and therefore we ſpeake againſt them. Your vowes, your inuocation of Saints, and your prayers for the ſoules departed, are ſuperfluous, and in your meaning, ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, &amp; in very déed very wicked &amp; blaſphemous. For what néede hath a Chriſtian to adde any vowe, to that which is made in baptiſme, ſith no man can truely ſay, that eyther he hath or could performe that vow ſo, but that God might iuſtly charge him with the lacke of performaunce thereof? That vowe is to forſake the deuill and all his works and pompes, the vanities of the wicked world, and all the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full luſtes of the fleſhe.

Bearing hys readers in hand, that <hi>Iudas</hi> ment to redéeme by Sacrifice, the ſinne that the flayne had committed, and to teache, that to pray for the deade, that they may be releaſed of theyr ſinnes, is an holy, and an holſome cogitation.</p>
                  <p>Thus, if this offerer and his fellowes wyll, they may ſée, vpon how ſlender a foundation, their opinion concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing praying for the ſoules departed, is builded.

                  <p>But finally, this Offerer dooth charge vs with ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king againſt the Church it ſelfe: flatly denying, that Chriſt hath here vpon earth, any ſpouſe or viſible Church, to bée heard ſpeake, perceyued or ſéene. Here I muſt ſay, that this Popiſh offerer dooth offer the Proteſtantes open wrong, in charging them with that which neuer any one amongeſt them (that is learned) hath affirmed, ſpoken or thought. It may be, that ſome ſuch amongeſt the Proteſtants, as haue not had the knowledge of the arte of reaſoning, haue béene by captions manner of reaſoning brought into ſuch a maſe that they could not deliuer themſelues from the captious Argumentes, that theſe ſubtyle Popiſh Catholiques doo vſe to frame. And ſo haue ſéemed to be conuinced, and enforced to graunt, that Chriſt hath no viſible Church here vppon earth: but ſuch amongſt the Proteſtant Catholiques as doo knowe howe to anſwer ſuch captious argumentes, are able and haue alwayes béene able, to vſe ſuch diſtinction as by
<pb facs="tcp:11401:84"/> the Arte of reaſoning are allowed to bée vſed, and thereby to make it playne, to as many as be not wilfully blind, that Chriſts Church that is here vpon earth, may in one reſpect be ſayd to be viſible, and in another reſpect, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame Church may be ſayd to bée inuiſible.</p>

                  <p>Well, let vs ſée what may be ſaid to this offer. Firſt (as I doo vnderſtand the wordes of this Offerer) hee affirmeth that till it was within the ſpace of thréeſcore, and ſome odde yéeres, laſt paſt, there had béene no Schiſme brought into the Church of Chriſt: ſo that before that tyme, al were of one Church, of one fayth and religion, and of one vnitie therein.

None of them may bée taken for falſe Prophets, Heretiques, or Schiſmatiques: if thys bée the meaning of this offerers wordes, as I thynke
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:11401:86"/> it muſt néedes bée. But how ſoeuer this offerer and his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, doo account of theſe men that then brought Schiſmes into the Church of Chriſt: we Proteſtants doo déeme them to be falſe Prophets, Heretiques, and Schiſmatickes, yea and members of antichriſt, and we doo by all meanes poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſhunne theyr doctrine, and teach all other Chriſtians to ſhunne them alſo.</p>
                  <p>It may bée that this offerer meant not of any other falſe Prophets, Heretiques or Schiſmatickes: then ſuch as haue troubled the Church of Chriſt within theſe thréeſcore and odde yéeres laſt paſt: and therefore hee beginneth with Luther, Zuinglius, &amp;c. But if that were his meaning, then I muſt tell him, that he and his fellowes (the antichriſtian catholiques) are the falſe Prophets, Heretiques and Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiques, that haue troubled the Catholique Church of Chriſt all this while, &amp; many hundrethes of yéeres before, euen euer ſince the dayes of <hi>Phocas</hi> the Emperour, and the dayes of <hi>Boniface</hi> the thyrd, theyr firſt Apoſtatate Biſhop of Roome.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Luther. Zuinglius,</hi> and <hi>Caluine,</hi> they dyd but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte from the antichriſtian Schiſmaticall Church, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in then had béene foſtered, and ioyned themſelues to the true catholique Church of Chriſt: euen as the Apoſtle <hi>Paule</hi> leauing the Hipocriticall profeſſion of a Phariſey, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he had béene brought vp euen at the féete of <hi>Gamaliell</hi> (the good Phariſey) ioyned himſelfe to the Church and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of Chriſt, which was not a forſaking of the lawe, but a cleauing vnto him that is the perfection of the Lawe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Luther, Zuinglius,</hi> and <hi>Caluine,</hi> dyd not take vpon them to be authors of any new religions: but they embraced, and laboured to maintayne, that olde religion, that had béene planted by the Apoſtles, and profeſſed by theyr immediate. ſucceſſors. And as they could, they dyd endeuour, to purge it of al ſuch filth as you (M. Offerer,) and your prediſſeſſors had begrimed it with.</p>
                  <p>If in this buſines, they dyd not ſo well in all poyntes as they wiſhed: yet theyr meaning béeing good, they are to
<pb facs="tcp:11401:87"/> bée helde excuſed. Though they dyd nowe and then buylde timber, ſtrawe and ſtubble: yet ſo long as they did laye no new foundation, but dyd ſet all theyr building, vppon the rocke Chriſt which is the right foundation, and the onely foundation, for Chriſtians to build vpon: they ſhalbe ſaued, as S. <hi>Paule</hi> hath aſſured vs. <hi>1, Cor, 3.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>We Proteſtant Catholiques, doo eſtéeme of theſe men, none otherwiſe, then as of faithfull labourers in the Lords harueſt, and carefull followers of Chriſt Ieſus. If they did in any poynt goe aſtray (as béeing men they might, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly dyd) our profeſſion is not to followe them.

                  <p>The learned Proteſtant therefore may conclude, that not the knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> catholique Church of Chriſt, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knowen antichriſtian Church of Roome (whereof this Offerer and his fellowes are members) haue by theyr doctrine, brought into the Church of Chriſt, Schiſme Diuiſion and ſeperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of one member from another, and of the whole miſticall body, from the true heade Ieſus Chriſt.

And we muſt acknowledge, that his colledge of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalles, and the Prelates, that he calleth togeather in hys generall councelles, binding them by an oath to maintaine the eſtate of your antichriſtian Church, are our maſters or teachers (for ſuche maſters our ſauiour Chriſt ſpake of at that tyme) and what ſo euer they ſhall teach, that muſt wée beléeue, although we doo knowe and ſée, that they doo teach directly contrarie to that which is taught by the holy ghoſt in the Scriptures.</p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:11401:87"/>
                  <p>The peace therefore, the concorde, and the vnitie, that you doo maintaine is not in verity and trueth: but in impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie and falſe religion. By your Schiſme, (wherein you are growen excéeding ſtrong) you haue diſperſed the flocke of Chriſt, which was at the firſt but one ſocietie and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.

And from amongſt your ſelues, there ſhall riſe vp men that ſhall vtter frowarde ſpeaches, that they may drawe ſchollers after them.</p>
                  <p>Not from the common knowen Catholique Church of Chriſt therefore (whereof wée Proteſtants are members) but from the now knowen antichriſtian Church (whereof this offerer and his fellowes are members) dyd that Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, procéede, that this Offerer ſpeaketh of.

                  <p>This matter béeing made ſo plaine, as to mee it dooth ſéeme to be: I doo thinke, that euery indifferent reader here of, will in hys heart ſay thus to this Offerer: for ſhame ſtay no longer, but yéelde and recant out of hand, leſt the heauie wrath of God fall vpon thée, for that thou haſt not yéelded and recanted before.</p>

Euen ſuch as was in <hi>Iamnes</hi> &amp; <hi>Mambres</hi> when they did reſiſt <hi>Moſes.</hi> By con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture, theſe two that S. <hi>Paule</hi> nameth in the third Chap. of his ſecond Epiſtle to <hi>Timoth:</hi> were the Sorcerers that ſtroue againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> in Egipt, and dyd by theyr ſorcerie, worke ſuch wonders (in outwarde appearaunce) as <hi>Moſes</hi> dyd by the mighty power of God in very déede, as in the 7.<note place="margin">Exod, 7, &amp;, 8</note> and 8. Chapters of <hi>Exod,</hi> it appeareth. But <hi>Moſes</hi> dooth
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:11401:88"/> not name thoſe ſorcerers, neyther are they named in any Hiſtory of the Scriptures: wherefore it may bee thought, that S. <hi>Paule</hi> had ſome other writings then are now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, whereby he gat the knowledge of the names of thoſe ſorcerers that dyd ſo withſtand <hi>Moſes.</hi> But howe ſo euer <hi>Moſes</hi> came by theyr names: this offerer hath not taken theyr names aright, for both the tranſlation that the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentine</hi> councell hath allowed of, and the <hi>Greeke</hi> text haue <hi>Iannes</hi> and not <hi>Iamnes:</hi> &amp; the Gréeke text hath <hi>Iambres</hi> and not <hi>Mambres.</hi> But the matter is not great: let the Offerer and his fellowes deſcide this matter at theyr leaſure.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle S. <hi>Paule,</hi> hauing deſcribed ſuch men as by the Spirite of prophecie, he did foreſée ſhould come in the latter dayes: he ſayth that they ſhould bée ſuch as reſiſt the trueth, euen as <hi>Iannes</hi> and <hi>Iambres</hi> did reſiſt <hi>Moſes.</hi> Howe thoſe ſorcerers did withſtand <hi>Moſes,</hi> dooth appeare in the two Chapters of <hi>Exodus</hi> that I haue noted before. They dyd what they could to diſcredit all that was doone by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:</hi> and to ſtay <hi>Pharao</hi> and the <hi>Egiptians</hi> from giuing cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite to that meſſadge that <hi>Moſes</hi> dyd from the Lord God of Iſraell. So long as the Lord would ſuffer them, they made ſhewes of as great and wonderfull workes, as thoſe were that were wrought by <hi>Moſes.</hi> Euen ſo (ſaith S. <hi>Paule</hi>) thoſe men doo withſtande the trueth: béeing men corrupted in minde, and lewde concerning the fayth. But they ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile no longer. For the madnes of theſe men ſhalbe made manifeſt to all men: euen as theirs was.</p>
                  <p>Now, let the indifferent reader iudge, who they bée in theſe dayes, that may moſt rightly be ſayd to be lyke vnto <hi>Iannes</hi> and <hi>Iambres:</hi> the Popiſh Catholiques, or we Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Catholiques.

                  <p>Yea, let y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> indifferent reader iudge whether of both y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſorts (proteſtants or roomiſh catholiques) may be déemed to be y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> men that S. <hi>Paule</hi> did Propheſie of in that third chapter of his ſecond Epiſtle to <hi>Timoth.</hi>

                  <p>The Chronicles or Hiſtories of times, doo witnes: that no men can bée, more lyke vnto theſe men that ſaint <hi>Paule</hi> hath here deſcribed, then the Popiſh prelates haue béene for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpace of theſe laſt, 1000. yéeres (almoſt) and ſo they doo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſtil: as daily experience dooth ſhew.

                  <p>Nowe therefore (as I thinke) the learned Proteſtante may eaſily prooue that rebellion and diſobedience to all ſuch powers as God hath ordayned and commaunded to be obei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, (yea, and to God himſelfe) is to be found, not in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church of Chriſt, but in the antichriſtian Church of Roome, which dooth call her ſelfe Catholique: and not in the Church and congregations of the Proteſtantes which it pleaſeth this offerer to call priuate.

What ſhould I here make mention of the Lutherans and Proteſtantes of our time? When the Lutherans in this realme haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken theyr iuſt ouerthrowe already, for the great deſire the Proteſtantes had to prefer the doctrine of Oecolampadians, Zuinglians and Calui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtes.

And doo not they denie that Chriſt hath ſatiſfied for them, which ſay they muſt ſatiſfie for themſelues?

                  <p>The trueth of this teſtimony (ſayth this offerer) is to bée tried by all ſectaries and ſortes of heretickes that euer haue

And it is not amiſſe that in that caſe they doo ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the words of the Apoſtle: But in the circumſtance of the text it appereth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the apoſtle meant rather of doctrin then of manners, although the place may be applied to both, becauſe true chriſtians doo teach both by doctrine, and by life.</p>

We can not abide to here the voice of ſtraungers.</p>
                  <p>Preciſians and Puritans we can not miſlike of, if they bée ſuch as all chriſtians ſhould bee: that is preciſe in obſeruing and kéeping of the commandements of God, according to that which is written <hi>Deut, 5,</hi>

I haue thought it good to take this occaſion to writ thus much, in the defence of right preciſenes and purenes of life: becauſe I doo ſée that our ſubtile enimie the deuill laboureth to bring into contempt, that preciſenes in obſeruing of Gods commaundements y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al chriſtians ſhold ſtriue to attaine vnto, and that purenes of life, that is moſt ſéemely for al chriſtians to walke in.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of our good God.

Theſe we Proteſtants doo not lyke of: but would as gladly be ridde of them as you would be of vs. And the number of them is not ſo great, as this offerer would haue it ſeme to be: neither are they furdered and fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of ſo many, as hee reporteth, although their number be greater then we wold wiſh it to be. It is perceiued, that they doo profeſſe and hold the true and right religion of Chriſt, and would gladly y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it were purged of all Roomiſh droſſe, and that the pure wheat that is in Gods threſhing floore, were clenſed from all roomiſh chaffe: but béeing caried away with faruent zeale, they runne before them that ſhould lead them, and doo hinder the cauſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they would gladly furder. When God wil, theſe ſhal by his good meanes be brought to conſider better of
<pb facs="tcp:11401:93"/> the matter: and you (roomiſh Catholiques) ſhalbe confounded. This offerer concludeth againſt him ſelfe and his fellows: for not we, but they, are the ſectaries &amp; heretiques y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by moouing, flitting and paſſing from euill to worſe, are now at the laſte come euen <hi>ad profundum malorum,</hi> to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very bottome of euil, and to a plaine &amp; open apoſtacy, and falling away from Chriſt and ioyning with antichriſt.

Now let the offerer and his fellowes marke what I ſhall ſay. For as much as, the hereſies of the popiſh Catholiques, haue béene from time to time, ſo fickle &amp; moouing, &amp; their end (in falling away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt) ſo horrible in the ſight of God: let any roomiſh Catholique liuing reply directly &amp; plainely, with out all cauill, colour, or fraude of words, without all vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table &amp; impertinent digreſſions, not only to this, but to all the anſwers y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I haue made, to the foreſayd ſignes, tokens and de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maundes: and then will I, for companie and good fellowſhip, leaue the true catholique church of Chriſt, wherin is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> plaine way of ſaluation, beaten by all our forefathers, the true Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique proteſtants for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpace of theſe, <hi>5530,</hi> and odde yeres, euen from the time of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt man, and now wander with the romane Catholiques, in their vncertaine by pathes of Popiſh deuiſes, through vnknowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deſerts of popiſh opinions, through rough woods, brambles &amp; briers of popiſh religions, to ſéeke in the ende, we can not tell what.</p>
                  <p>The offerers exhortation.</p>
                  <p>And here to conclude, and for my parte to miniſter vnto you ſome oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion in the relinquiſhing of theſe priuate churches and congregations of ſectaries, to returne to the vnity &amp; attonement of the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> knowen ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church of Chriſt, where ſtability and conſtancy of faith &amp; religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is onely to be found, I ſhall here lay before you the worthy example of the bleſſed martir Sebaſtian, by him brought of a loafe of bread to Genſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richus then king of the Vandalles, a furious and a barbarous nation, which breaking into Affricke, they found there many valiant Captaines placed by the Emperour Theodoſius the ſecond, for the defence &amp; ſauegard of the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:11401:93"/> country: amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt the reſt was this Sebaſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by dignity an earle, &amp; a couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and valiant Captaine, who with the reſt yeelding to the force of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerichus, was, as Victor de perſecutione Vandalorum writeth, for his great wiſedome and valiantnes not ſo much beloued as feared of the king Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerichus, who being an Arrian intended by collour of religion to work his death. For Genſerichus knowing Sebaſtian to be a ſeuere &amp; perfect chriſti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>an man, conuented him before the Arrian Biſhops, &amp; vnder the pretence that Amity and freendſhip might be the ſurer, and continue the longer be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>twixt them Genſerichus mooued him to become an Arrian, &amp; to profeſſe the ſame fayth and religion, as he and his people were of. For anſwer thys holy martyr Sebaſtian requeſted Genſerichus the king to command a fine wheaten loafe to be brought vnto him. And taking it in his hand. (And here to omit many of his words &amp; notable ſayings) he requeſted the King Genſerichus, to commaund the loafe of bread to be broken in peeces, to be ground, brought to floure, and boulted a freſh, to be ſeaſoned with water, &amp; ſalt, and baked againe, if then it ſhould in the ende prooue better bread then it was before, he would not faile to accompliſh the king Genſerichus his wil and pleaſure: but if it were not poſſible by breaking the loafe, &amp; baking it againe, to better it, but to make worſe bred then before, he wold not, nor cold not conſent therunto: &amp; in fine ſuffered death in defence of the chriſtian faith &amp; religion by him already profeſſed &amp; receiued, rather then he would condiſcend to the imparing, infringing or breaking of any parte thereof. And ſo Genſerichus cauſed this bleſſed man Sebaſtian to die a holy Martyr. Thus much I haue breefly deducted out of the hiſtorye of victor, to the intent that ſo apte and familier an example of ſo holy &amp; bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a martir, might in theſe perplexities and doubts in theſe ofte changes and mutations of religion, comfort the weaklings of Chriſt his Church, &amp; bring them to ſome more better ſtay, when by this example of Seba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians Loafe, certaine and ſure we may be, that the loafe of the vnitie of Chriſt his Church, the loafe of his Goſpell, faith and religion, being by Schiſme and Hereſie neuer ſo oft broken, neuer ſo finely grinded, boulted ſearced and ſifted, kneaded, and baked againe &amp; againe, they ſhall neuer be able to better it, or to bring it to that perfection which it had before. And therefore, all theyr attempts to the contrary are moſt vaine, the only remembrance of this Sebaſtians loafe ſhold ſuffiſe to confirme the faithful, to ſtay the wauering and weakelings, and to plucke the diſceiued bake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, &amp; to cauſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in leuing of this the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>That example, that you ſay, you will lay before vs, to giue vs occaſion to leaue theſe priuate churches and congregations of ſectaries, and to returne to the vnity, &amp;c: is a very méete ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to be vſed by the learned Proteſtant, that (if it be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) he may thereby drawe you backe againe, from your apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy, (wherein you run a whoring after Roomiſh Idols, and delite your ſelfe in antichriſtian breathing out of blaſphemy, againſt God and all godlines) to embrace that vnity &amp; attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is in verity, profeſſed by that common knowen catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique church of Chriſt: wherin ſtability and conſtancy of faith and religion were to be found in that time wherin <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> ſuffered manfully for the teſtimony of Chriſt, and was made a martir, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is a witnes of Chriſt. As for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth of the hiſtorie that you cite out of <hi>Victor,</hi> I wil not impech it, although I do find in hiſtories, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> ſuffered martirdom in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> daies of <hi>Diocletian,</hi> which was 100 yeres &amp; more before either <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotius ſecundus</hi> or <hi>Genſerichus</hi> did beare any rule at al. But let y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hiſtory be as true as you would wiſh it to be: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> example is the thing that may ſerue the learned proteſtants purpoſe verie well. <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> being conuented before the <hi>Arian</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, is by king <hi>Genſerichus</hi> required to become an <hi>Arian:</hi> but for anſwere he requeſteth the king to commaund a fine wheaten loafe to be brought vnto him, which being doone, hee requeſteth the king, to commaund the ſame loafe to bee broken into péeces. &amp;c. Here the learned Proteſtant will ſay, that the wheat wherof this loafe was made, did not grow in the field of that romiſh Catholique Church, that this Offe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rer doth brag ſo much off, neither was it threſſhed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing flowre, ground in that myll, ſifted with that Siue, or boulted with that boulter, nor knode in that kneading fatte, nor baked in that ouen. For at that time (which was about y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end of the firſt 300 yéeres after Chriſt) the Church that was in Rome, was nothing like that romane Church that now is and hath bene euer ſince the daies of the Emperour <hi>Phocas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:11401:94"/>
                  <p>The learned proteſtant will ſay, that this loafe was made of that wheate which was ſowed by that ſower y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> went foorth to ſowe his ſéede. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.<note place="margin">Ma. 13</note> and being threſhed in his threſhing floore with the flaile of bitter perſecution, was fanned or wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowed by him y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath his fanne in his hand, to purge his thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing floore. <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.<note place="margin">Ma. 3</note> and grownd in the Mill of oppreſſion, &amp; ſif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or bowlted, with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſiue or bowlter of tentation, &amp; knoden with the water of vnfayned &amp; hearty contrition, &amp; in the end, baked in the Ouen of hotte &amp; feruent loue &amp; zeale, to true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. And all this was done in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time that was paſt, when <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſtian</hi> required the king to call for a fine wheaten loafe. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny had aſſaied (before that time) to make this bread better, by breaking of this loafe, and by working of it againe: but they could neuer bring it to paſſe, for the baker y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> did firſt bake it, is ſo ſkilfull in baking ſuch bread, that it is not poſſible for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to amend that bread y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he baketh, or to bake any of the like goodnes. They that attempted this matter, before <hi>Sebaſtians</hi> time, were theſe, whoſe names doo enſue. <hi>Symon Magus, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> the Copperſmyth, <hi>Hymenaeus</hi> and <hi>Philetus, Nicolas</hi> the deacon, <hi>Cerinthus, Menander, Ebion, Gnoſtici, Baſilides, Saturninus, Valentinus, Syrenus, Carpocrates, Marcellina, Montanus, Seuerus, Tacianus, Alogiana ſecta, Hierarchas, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillus, Noetus, Tertulianiſtae, Origianiſtae, Nouatus, Sabellicus, Nepos, Paulus Samoſatenus, Martion, Manes.</hi> All theſe had endeuoured (before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> daies of <hi>Sebaſtian</hi>) to make better bread of this loafe, then the heauenly baker had made: but it would not be. And euen ſo haue a number moe done, ſince the dayes wherein <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> ſuffred martyrdome: but all in vaine. Yea, and none haue at any time done more in this matter, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this Offerer &amp; his fellowes haue done &amp; doo ſtill: but all their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is loſt, &amp; ſo ſhall it be ſtill, let them doo what they can to amend it, they ſhall finde in the end that it is ſo perfect, that no man can be able to amend it, or to make y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> like. The lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned proteſtant therefore, neither wil nor can conſent, to leaue that church or congregation (which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Offerer calleth priuate) which is in déed moſt publike, &amp; hath in it that ſtability &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie of faith &amp; religion, that none other church either hath, or can haue: for it hath continued euen from the beginng, &amp; is rightly figured by that loafe of <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Offerer hath
<pb facs="tcp:11401:95"/> ſpoken of: for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heauenly baker alone, hath mowlded, made &amp; baked it: &amp; hath giuen it vertue to féed vnto euerlaſting life, al ſuch as doo or ſhall taſte thereof, &amp; take pleaſure therein: yea, rather then the learned proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t would forſake this heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> or houſe of bread, &amp; ioyne himſelfe to the Romiſh <hi>Bethauen,</hi> or houſe of vanity &amp; confuſion: he will yéeld to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer moſt painful death in his body: for that chriſtian religion &amp; faith, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he hath already receiued &amp; profeſſed. Which is in déed the right Catholique faith &amp; religion of Chriſt Ieſus: to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing, infringing, or breaking of any part wherof, he wil in no caſe condiſcend or agrée. Thus this Offerer &amp; his fellowes may ſée, how aptly this example of <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> ſerueth for the ſtaying &amp; confirming of ſuch proteſtants in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church of Chriſt, as be weake, &amp; are (by theſe often chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges of religion) brought into perplexities &amp; doubts. For by this example of <hi>Sebaſtians</hi> loafe: we may be moſt certaine &amp; ſure, that although y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loafe of the vnity of Chriſts church, the loafe of his goſpell &amp; religion, be by ſchiſmes &amp; hereſies, neuer ſo often broken, neuer ſo fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grinded, bowlted, ſearced, &amp; ſifted, kneaded, &amp; baked againe, and againe: yet it is moſt apparant, that no goodnes can be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the firſt goodnes, that is in this bread, which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heauenly baker hath baked. Let this Offerer &amp; his fellows therefore, haue a due conſideration of <hi>Sebaſtians</hi> loafe, for thereby they may be confirmed in the right faith of Chriſt, ſtaied from wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering, pluckt back againe from their erroures, and cauſed to procéede from one degrée of perfection to another: yea, &amp; to ſtay the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues from ſcattering abroad with Antichriſt, to ſéeke ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation here &amp; there, and they know not where.
